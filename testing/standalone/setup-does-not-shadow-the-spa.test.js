/**
 * Nothing is mounted at `/setup`, so the SPA's own first-run page is reachable.
 *
 * ## Deprecation 1.5, and why it waited three releases
 *
 * `setupRouter` was mounted twice: at `/api/setup`, which is what the SPA polls for `configExists()`, and
 * again at `/setup`, which served a server-rendered HTML form and `404`ed once configured. Express matches a
 * mount before the SPA's index fallback, so the second line made the Angular `/setup` route **unreachable**.
 * The legacy form was the live first-run path and the SPA's own page had never served one.
 *
 * It was kept "for non-SPA access" from before the SPA existed. Removing it is one line, and the risk is why
 * it waited: this is the unauthenticated boot path, and getting it wrong means an instance nobody can set up.
 *
 * ## The two pages were NOT the same flow, which is what the proof found
 *
 * The legacy form asked for a label and nothing else. The SPA page asks for a label, a settings password and
 * a confirmation, and keeps its submit disabled until all three are filled. So "the SPA route exists" was
 * never evidence that removing the mount was safe — it collects different information and posts a different
 * body.
 *
 * ## What was proven, end to end, against a genuine first run
 *
 * Config deleted and the database dropped, then through a browser at `/setup`:
 *
 *     GET /setup                  ->  200, and the response is the SPA shell, not the form
 *     app-root present            ->  true
 *     password fields             ->  2   (the legacy form had 0)
 *     setup completes             ->  a token appears after ~15s
 *     GET /api/setup/status       ->  configured: false  ->  true
 *     the issued token            ->  200 on /api/tokens/me and /api/spaces
 *
 * The 15 seconds matter and are the reason this is not a five-second check: the first boot creates the
 * default space and starts an index build, so the page sits on "Setting up…" for a while. A shorter wait
 * reports NO TOKEN and looks exactly like the failure this test exists to catch.
 *
 * ## And again when the FORM was deleted, 2026-09-02
 *
 * Unmounting `/setup` left the form, its `POST` handler and the HTML error page in the file. Removing those
 * was re-proven against a genuine first run on an isolated instance, because it is still the boot path:
 *
 *     GET /api/setup/status       ->  configured: false
 *     GET /setup                  ->  200, and ZERO forms in the body
 *     GET /api/setup              ->  404   (the form endpoint is gone)
 *     POST /api/setup  (form)     ->  404   (its handler is gone)
 *     POST /api/setup/json  101c  ->  400, naming the 100-character limit
 *     POST /api/setup/json  100c  ->  201 with the one-time token
 *     GET /api/setup/status       ->  configured: true
 *     the issued token            ->  200 on /api/tokens/me
 *     POST /api/setup/json again  ->  404
 *
 * The 101-character case is there because deleting the form surfaced that `SETUP_LABEL_MAX` had only ever
 * been enforced by the form's handler — so the path the SPA uses had been unbounded since the mount went.
 *
 * ## What this file can assert, and what it cannot
 *
 * A browser first-run cannot run here — that is the `verify` skill's scratch instance, and the recipe is in
 * `scratchpad/verify/firstrun.mjs`. What is gated here is the thing that regresses silently: the mount coming
 * back. A re-added `app.use('/setup', …)` would restore the shadow with no test failing anywhere else,
 * because every other suite reaches setup through `/api/setup`.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/setup-does-not-shadow-the-spa.test.js
