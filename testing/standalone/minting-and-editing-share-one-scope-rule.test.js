/**
 * The mint route and the edit routes decide "outside your scope" with the SAME function.
 *
 * ## The claim that was not true
 *
 * `PATCH /api/tokens/:id` carries this comment: *"Same rule the MINT route applies to a space-restricted
 * creator, expressed once in `refusalsOutsideEditorScope` so the two cannot drift into disagreeing about
 * what 'outside your scope' means."*
 *
 * Three routes called that function. The mint route was not one of them. It had its own inline check —
 * and the two did not merely differ, they disagreed about which FIELD describes a token's scope:
 *
 * ```
 * if (creatorSpaces) {
 *   if (schemaLibrary) { … }
 *   else if (!spaces) { 403 }        // ← the deprecated allowlist
 *   else { … }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## What that cost, and it is not hypothetical
 *
 * The per-space rights matrix has been the permission model since 2.6, and the token-create form in this
 * repo's own UI stopped sending `spaces` some releases ago — it mints with `rights` only. Put those
 * together and a **space-restricted administrator could not mint any token at all through the product's
 * own interface**: no `spaces` in the body, so `!spaces` is true, so 403 *"A space-restricted token
 * cannot create an unrestricted (all-spaces) token"* — about a request that was not unrestricted.
 *
 * An unrestricted admin never saw it, because `creatorSpaces` is `undefined` for them and the whole block
 * is skipped. That is why it could sit there: the people most likely to test the mint form are exactly
 * the people the bug cannot reach.
 *
 * ## Why a gate rather than just the fix
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md` names one rule with two implementations as the defect this repo produces most, and says the
 * weaker one wins silently. Here the weaker one was a PRIVILEGE boundary reading a deprecated field, with
 * a comment two hundred lines away asserting that the unification had already happened. A comment cannot
 * hold that; a gate can.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/minting-and-editing-share-one-scope-rule.test.js
