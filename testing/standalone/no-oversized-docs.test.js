/**
 * No shipped document grows past 900 lines.
 *
 * ## The rule was already agreed; this is what makes it hold
 *
 * Five documents had crossed 1,000 lines before anyone noticed, and the largest was 2,037 — the biggest file
 * in the repository, roughly twice the next. Splitting them (Q-7, #796-#800) fixed the instances. It does not
 * fix the mechanism, which is that a document grows one paragraph at a time and no single commit ever looks
 * like the one that made it unreadable.
 *
 * Three concrete costs, all of them measured rather than asserted:
 *
 *  1. **Retrieval.** The canary reads our documentation INTO Ythril. `04-brain-api.md` at 57,642 B chunked
 *     into TWO pieces, and they could not retrieve anything specific from it — a whole API reference reduced
 *     to two undifferentiated blobs. `chunk-size-bounded.test.js` guards the chunker; this guards the input.
 *  2. **Drift inside one file.** `Sorting (all brain list endpoints)` sat as an H4 under `List Entities` while
 *     being linked from the chrono and file-metadata tables. A cross-cutting rule filed under one resource is
 *     the shape long files produce, because there is nowhere else to put it that a reader would find.
 *  3. **Silent loss on the eventual split.** The Brain API reference carried `ation naming the missing
 *     capability — diagnostic, not display copy.` for THIRTEEN releases: the tail of a 20-line block cut off
 *     mid-word by an earlier split. The bigger the file, the less likely anyone reads the seam.
 *
 * ## Why 900 and not 1,000
 *
 * MEASURED, not chosen for roundness. With all five splits in, the largest surviving document is
 * `02-hosting.md` at 817 lines and the next is 611. A limit of 1,000 could not fire against anything that
 * exists — it would be a gate that passes forever and reads like protection. 900 leaves 02-hosting room to
 * grow and still catches the next file heading for four figures.
 *
 * Raising the limit is a legitimate move if a document genuinely needs it. Doing so in the same commit that
 * makes a file too long is not, which is why the number is here and not in a config file.
 *
 * ## `git ls-files`, not the filesystem
 *
 * What ships is what git tracks. `docs/docker-build-protocol.md` is gitignored — it exists on a maintainer's
 * disk and in no clone, no image and no build — and a filesystem walk once made a different docs gate demand
 * a Help entry for it, which would have 404'd for every user.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/no-oversized-docs.test.js

 * The tracked docs and their line counts.

 * Several patterns because git's pathspec is not a shell glob: a single-star pattern does not descend, and a
 * double-star one does not mean what a shell means by it. The repo has one level of nesting under `docs/`
 * (the split guides); a third, two-deep pattern is cheaper than a wrong assumption, so it is included too.

 * error points at the following line and reads as a syntax error in ordinary code.)
