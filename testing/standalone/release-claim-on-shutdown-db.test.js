/**
 * Database-level test: a planned shutdown hands its claims back instead of waiting out the stall timer.
 *
 * ## The finding (lens 7, Reliability & Resilience)
 *
 * `stopMediaEmbeddingWorker()` exists, and its own doc comment promises it "completes the in-flight batch".
 * The shutdown path never called it. Three consequences, all from one missing call:
 *
 *   1. the worker kept CLAIMING new jobs while the process drained — a job picked up in the last second of
 *      life is abandoned instantly;
 *   2. whatever it held died with `status: processing` and a live claim token, so recovery had to wait out the
 *      full `stalledJobTimeoutMs` (five minutes by default) on the next boot before re-queuing it. A rolling
 *      restart pays that per in-flight job, per pod;
 *   3. `closeMongo()` ran while the worker might be mid-write, so its writes failed with connection errors
 *      that look like real failures and can spend a retry attempt.
 *
 * Stall recovery is for when nobody can say what happened. A planned shutdown CAN say, and saying so is worth
 * one write.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:up` first, then
 *      node --test testing/standalone/release-claim-on-shutdown-db.test.js
