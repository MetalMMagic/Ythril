/**
 * Database-level test: a space's usage rows do not outlive the space, and they follow a rename.
 *
 * ## The finding (lens 8, Data Integrity) — self-inflicted, two hours old
 *
 * `dropSpaceData` removes every collection whose name starts with `<spaceId>_`. `space_activity` is
 * **instance-wide**, keyed `<space>:<hour>`, so the prefix drop cannot reach it. Two consequences:
 *
 *   1. deleting a space leaves its usage rows behind for up to the 90-day retention — and **a space recreated
 *      with the same id inherits them**, so a brand-new empty space's Usage panel claims hundreds of recalls
 *      it never served. That is worse than showing nothing, because it is confidently wrong;
 *   2. a rename moves the collections and leaves the activity rows under the old id, so the renamed space
 *      starts blank while orphaned rows linger under an id that no longer exists.
 *
 * The lens names this exactly: *cascade deletion of derived artifacts so nothing is orphaned*. It was worth
 * running the lens over code written the same day — the collection is new, and every existing cascade was
 * written before it existed.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:up` first, then
 *      node --test testing/standalone/space-activity-lifecycle-db.test.js
