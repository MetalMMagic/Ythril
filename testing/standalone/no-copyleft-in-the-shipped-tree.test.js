/**
 * No copyleft licence anywhere in the redistributed tree — direct or transitive — without a recorded election.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes, and why it was a reasonable gap
 *
 * `notice-coverage.test.js` checks that every **direct** dependency of both workspaces is attributed, and it says
 * plainly why it stops there:
 *
 *   > Transitive dependencies are also out of scope here. That is a deliberate limit, not an oversight: the full
 *   > transitive set is thousands of packages, and a gate nobody can satisfy is a gate that gets deleted.
 *
 * That is correct for **attribution**. It is not correct for **copyleft**, and the difference is the whole point of
 * this file: attributing 1,147 MIT packages individually would be unsatisfiable busywork, but the number of
 * packages in that tree with a restrictive licence is *two*. That set is small, it is checkable in seconds, and it
 * is the one that carries legal consequence.
 *
 * ## What the audit lens found
 *
 * `jszip` is offered as `MIT OR GPL-3.0-or-later`. It is pulled in transitively by `exceljs` and **ships in the
 * browser bundle** — so a GPL arm was being redistributed to every user with no record of which arm applied.
 * `docs/dependencies.md` meanwhile stated that exactly *one* package was dual-licensed with a copyleft arm and
 * concluded that "no copyleft restrictions apply to any redistributed npm package". The conclusion held, because
 * MIT is available; the reasoning did not, because nobody had looked.
 *
 * Nothing was wrong in the product. What was wrong is that the claim could not be checked.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Everything present in `node_modules` after an install, which is a superset of what ships. A `devDependency` with
 * a copyleft licence is not a redistribution problem — so a hit that is build-time only can be recorded as such in
 * `DEV_ONLY` rather than needing a NOTICE entry it does not deserve.
 *
 * Run: `npm ci` first, then
 *      node --test testing/standalone/no-copyleft-in-the-shipped-tree.test.js
