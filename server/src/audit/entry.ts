/**
 * The shape of one stored audit row.
 *
 * ## Why it lives here and not in `config/types.ts`
 *
 * It was there, and `no-new-god-files.test.js` refused the one-line addition that would have made it 580 code
 * lines with the reason this file exists: *"the failure mode of a god-file is not its size on any given day — it
 * is that every change lands in the same place because that is where the code already is."* An audit row is not
 * configuration. It was in the config types only because that file was where types went.
 *
 * Moving it took 34 lines OUT of a frozen file rather than adding one to it, and there was exactly one importer
 * plus one gate to repoint — which is the argument for doing it at the moment the ratchet asks rather than
 * raising the number.
