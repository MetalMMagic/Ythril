/**
 * Re-arming a scheduler whose expression has not changed leaves it alone.
 *
 * ## Why this matters, and it is not tidiness
 *
 * The config-reload path re-arms three cron schedulers, and the backup route re-arms a fourth. Both are called
 * on ANY save — a reload triggered by an edit to an unrelated setting, a backup-config save that only changed a
 * retention count. Restarting a `node-cron` task does not just cost a stop and a start: **it resets the phase.**
 * A network on a quarter-hour cron that was ninety seconds from its next sync goes back to a full fifteen
 * minutes, and an operator adjusting three fields in a row pushes it three times.
 *
 * That is the same argument used to keep the INTERVAL-driven sweeps out of the re-arm helper entirely — a
 * six-hour timer whose phase resets on every save may never fire. Applying it only to the sweeps and not to the
 * cron schedulers would be the rule implemented once and skipped next door, which is what this repo's worst
 * defects are made of.
 *
 * ## Why the check is structural
 *
 * Exercising it needs a running instance with a config, a database and real clock time. What can be asserted
 * without one is the property that was missing: each `start*` compares the expression it is ABOUT to arm against
 * the one it has armed, and returns early when they match — and clears that memory when it stops, or a stopped
 * scheduler would look armed and never restart.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/rearming-a-schedule-is-idempotent.test.js
