/**
 * The shared source listing refuses to answer with nothing.
 *
 * ## What this guards, and why it is not obvious
 *
 * Ten gates ask "what does the server contain" and then assert something about every answer. If the listing
 * ever returns empty — a `git` that failed, a path typed wrong, a rename — every one of those loops runs
 * zero times and every one of them passes. The gate then reports a green tick about a set it never read,
 * which is precisely the defect the whole `Q-6` sweep exists to remove, one level up.
 *
 * So the floor lives inside `trackedSources` and THROWS. These cases are what make that a fact rather than
 * an intention: a helper whose failure mode has never been observed is a claim.
