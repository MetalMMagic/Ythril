/**
 * Every field a space's type schema accepts must be REACHABLE from the editor.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists for
 *
 * `retention` shipped end to end — the API accepted it, the sweep applied it, the Danger Zone listed the
 * windows a type had, the integration guide said *"set a type's window on the type, in the Schema tab"*, and
 * the release notes announced it. There was no such control. The only way to configure the middle tier of
 * `record > schema > space` was a hand-written `PATCH`, and a canary operator found that out by looking for
 * the input the documentation promised.
 *
 * Nothing was red. Each layer was individually correct; the gap was between them, and the layer that could
 * have caught it — a test asserting the editor covers what the API takes — did not exist.
 *
 * ## Two directions, because the pair is what breaks
 *
 *  1. every key the inline `TypeSchemaZ` accepts is written by the client's `typeSchemaFromState()`;
 *  2. the schema LIBRARY's own schema still refuses `retention` — three code comments, a documented bullet
 *     and the `withRetention: false` call all assert that a library entry cannot carry a delete window. If
 *     someone adds the field there, those become wrong silently.
 *
 * Plus a floor: if the parse stops matching, an empty key list would pass while checking nothing.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/type-schema-editable.test.js
