/**
 * Every space request body refuses a key it does not know.
 *
 * ## The defect this closes
 *
 * Four of the ten body schemas were `.strict()` and six were not, and the split fell across one nesting level:
 *
 *     PATCH {"meta":{"validationMdoe":"strict"}}     -> 400, refused
 *     PATCH {"label":"x","validaitonMode":"strict"}  -> 200, label applied and the typo gone
 *
 * The same misspelling, refused one level down and swallowed one level up. A typo in `faceDescriptorDims`
 * created a space at the DEFAULT descriptor width and reported 201 — the caller's notes say 512, the gallery
 * is 128, and nothing in the response, the record or the log distinguishes the two.
 *
 * It is the same failure the token mint route had in 2.6, where `{"spaceIds":["qa"]}` returned 201 with no
 * scoping at all. That one was closed by `.strict()`; this is the rest of it.
 *
 * ## Why it needed a ruling and not just a commit
 *
 * Refusing is BREAKING for any integrator currently sending a key we ignore: a 200 becomes a 400 on a request
 * whose shape has not changed. Parked as P-4 with A recommended, and the owner ruled A on 2026-08-15.
 *
 * ## Why the list is DERIVED
 *
 * A hand-written list of ten names is a second copy that goes stale the moment somebody adds an eleventh
 * body — and the failure mode is silence, because a body nobody listed is a body nobody checks. So the names
 * come out of the module itself: every exported `z.object(...)` in `body-schemas.ts` must carry `.strict()`.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/space-bodies-are-strict.test.js
 * (requires a prior `npm run build` in server/)
