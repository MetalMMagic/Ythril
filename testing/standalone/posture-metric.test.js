/**
 * The security posture is countable, so a fleet can alert on it (observability audit, lens 9).
 *
 * ## The finding
 *
 * `computeSecurityPosture()` produces PASS/WARN/FAIL checks that are printed once at boot and served on
 * `GET /api/about/security`. Both are pull-only and human-shaped, so the way a fleet learned that an
 * instance came up misconfigured was somebody reading its boot log. Nobody reads five boot logs — and the
 * checks that matter most are the ones with no runtime symptom at all: `requireEncryptedTransport` off, or
 * on WITHOUT `trustProxy`, which rejects every request with a 403 that looks like a client problem.
 *
 * ## What this pins
 *
 * The gauge exists, counts by level, is derived from the SAME function as the endpoint (never a second copy
 * of the rules), reports zeros rather than nothing when no posture has been computed, and cannot make a
 * scrape fail.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/posture-metric.test.js
