/**
 * Admin: every space's usage side by side.
 *
 * The per-space endpoint (`GET /api/brain/spaces/:id/activity`) answers "is THIS space useful". This one
 * answers the question the owner actually asked — *which spaces are how useful* — and that is a comparison, so
 * it has to arrive in one response.
 *
 * One route rather than letting the Spaces page call the per-space endpoint once per row: that would be a
 * front-end N+1, which the performance lens that ran the day before this shipped names explicitly as a red
 * flag. Sixty-five spaces would be sixty-five requests to render one table.
 *
 * Admin-only, because it is inherently cross-space: a space-scoped token has no business learning how heavily
 * every other space is used, and the per-space route exists for it.
