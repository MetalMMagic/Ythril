/**
 * A rate limit an admin can set per TOKEN, under a ceiling infra can set instance-wide.
 *
 * Owner request, 2026-08-20: *"ratelimit should be settable on token by instance admin"* and *"and instancewide
 * by infra"*. Two tiers, and the pure resolution lives here so it can be tested without an HTTP server.
 *
 * ## The bucket was already per token — only the ceiling was a constant
 *
 * `clientRateLimitKey` has always keyed the global limiter on a hash of the credential, so requests were already
 * counted per token. `max: 300` was simply hardcoded. This is not a new counting mechanism; it is the number
 * becoming resolvable.
 *
 * ## Why a SECOND limiter rather than making the existing one token-aware
 *
 * The global limiter runs BEFORE authentication, deliberately — it is the only throttle in front of admin TOTP
 * verification, so it has to throttle requests carrying no valid credential at all. That means it cannot know
 * which token a request holds: answering that needs a bcrypt compare against every stored token, per request.
 *
 * So the per-token quota is enforced after auth, where the record is already resolved and free. The pre-auth
 * limiter is untouched and remains the outer backstop for the anonymous surface.
 *
 * ## Resolution, in the order this codebase already resolves tiers
 *
 * `record > instance > default`, the same shape as `ttlDays` and `suppressEmbeddings`:
 *
 *   1. the token's own `rateLimitPerMinute`, set by an instance admin;
 *   2. `YTHRIL_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, set by infra;
 *   3. `DEFAULT_PER_MINUTE`, which is the number the global limiter has always used — so an instance that sets
 *      nothing behaves exactly as it does today.
 *
 * ## The infra value is a CEILING, not just a default
 *
 * If it were only a default, an admin could set a per-token value above it and infra's control would be
 * decorative. So a write above the ceiling is **refused, naming the ceiling** — never accepted and clamped.
 * Storing a smaller number than the caller asked for, and answering 200, is the defect this repo keeps finding:
 * the caller is told it worked and the thing they asked for did not happen.
