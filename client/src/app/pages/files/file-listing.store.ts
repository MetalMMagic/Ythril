/**
 * The directory listing: its state, its five requests, and the one rule that decides how it loads.
 *
 * G-3's eighth cut, and the largest of the four `filesApi` groups the page shell still owned.
 *
 * ## The rule that had to move as ONE thing
 *
 * `load` decides **load-versus-refresh** from three facts at once — is this the path we are already showing,
 * are there rows on screen, and did the last attempt fail — and drives four flags from the answer. It has six
 * callers: the navigation, the progress poll, the retry button and three post-mutation reloads.
 *
 * It is one function on purpose. Asking each caller to classify itself is how five get it right and one does
 * not, which is the exact shape of the retention bug fixed in #632. **So the callers say what they did, never
 * what it counts as** — there is no `isRefresh` parameter here, and adding one would undo the fix.
 *
 * **Two facts, not three.** The rule tested `loadError` as well until `G-14`; see `load` for why that
 * clause is now a comment. It is the second line in two commits that turned out to be unable to decide
 * anything, and both were found the same way — by mutating them and watching the suite stay green.
 *
 * The two halves of that rule are opposite by design and both have a bug behind them:
 *
 * - **A failed NAVIGATION clears the rows.** The failure message renders in place of the "empty folder"
 *   state, so rows left on screen hide it completely — the breadcrumb said one folder and the table listed
 *   another, with nothing to say the listing had failed.
 * - **A failed REFRESH keeps them** and marks them not-current. A poll that loses a request during an ingest
 *   must not blank a table that is perfectly good.
 *
 * A refactor flattening those two into one branch is the most likely way to break this file, which is why
 * both are pinned by characterization cases and by mutants.
 *
 * ## Why a store and not a component, and why page-provided
 *
 * The same reason the tree's store gives, and it applies harder here: the listing renders inside the Brain's
 * tab strip, so a component owning `listFiles` would cancel the request whenever the operator looked at
 * another tab. `providers: [FileListingStore]` on the page — one instance per page, because a listing belongs
 * to the space and folder that page is showing.
 *
 * ## What it publishes rather than does
 *
 * `listed` and `listingFailed` carry the outcome of a listing; the page connects them to the tree sidebar and
 * to the progress poll. That indirection is deliberate: **this store does not know the tree exists.** The
 * page owns both and is the only place that knows they are related, which is also what the tree store's own
 * docblock asks for. `mutated` and `mutationFailed` are the same idea for the writes — this class reloads the
 * directory, and everything else a mutation means is the page's decision.
