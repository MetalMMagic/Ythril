/**
 * The server has no import cycle that survives to runtime.
 *
 * ## What this angle found, and what it did not
 *
 * Lens 2's import-direction question, quantified over `server/src` (232 modules):
 *
 *   - **2 cycles in the TypeScript source**, both a pair in the same directory:
 *     `audit-changes` ↔ `audit-schema-summary`, and `recall` ↔ `lexical-search`.
 *   - **0 cycles in the emitted JavaScript.** Each pair is one value import and one `import type` back, and
 *     the type import is erased — `dist/audit/audit-schema-summary.js` contains zero references to
 *     `audit-changes`, and `dist/brain/lexical-search.js` zero to `recall`. Checked in `dist`, not inferred
 *     from the compiler flags.
 *   - **14 "upward" imports** (core reaching toward the edge) by a naive directory ranking, of which ten were
 *     the ranking being wrong (`util` and `metrics` legitimately use `config` and `db`). The remaining four
 *     survive reading: `auth → mcp/oauth` builds the `WWW-Authenticate` resource-metadata URL the OAuth spec
 *     requires; `brain/tombstone-prune → sync/*` reads the peer watermark so a prune cannot delete a
 *     tombstone that would then resurrect from a peer; `config/model-egress-exposure → files/…/vlm-endpoint`
 *     reuses the real endpoint resolver rather than growing a second copy of it.
 *
 * So the angle produced no defect — which is a result, and the reason this file exists is to keep it one.
 *
 * ## Why the check is "survives erasure" and not "no cycles"
 *
 * A source-level cycle broken by `import type` is not a hazard: nothing is evaluated, nothing can be
 * `undefined` at module-init time. Forbidding those would mean rewriting two honest type imports to satisfy a
 * rule about a problem that does not exist — and the first person to hit it would work around the gate rather
 * than the code. What matters is a cycle among the imports that actually run.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/no-runtime-import-cycles.test.js
