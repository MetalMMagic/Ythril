/**
 * A schema-library entry refuses `retention`, and the refusal explains itself.
 *
 * ## What was actually wrong, having read the code
 *
 * This was filed as "two surfaces, one weaker: the library cannot express a field the inline schema can". Two thirds
 * of that dissolved on reading:
 *
 *  - the client already strips it — `typeSchemaFromState(..., { withRetention: false })`;
 *  - the docs already state it AND give the reason, in `04-brain-api.md`.
 *
 * So the omission was never an oversight. A library entry is referenced by any number of spaces, and a delete policy
 * is not a property of a shape. What was missing was the explanation at the **point of refusal**: `.strict()` alone
 * answers `Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'retention'`, which tells a direct API caller that a field valid one place
 * is invalid here, and nothing about why — inviting them to report it as a bug.
 *
 * That is the whole change, and this test pins the two things that make it worth having: the field is still refused,
 * and the message says why.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/library-retention-refusal.test.js
 * (requires a prior `npm run build` in server/)
