/**
 * Derive a rights matrix for every token that lacks one, once, and write it down.
 *
 * ## Why it is here and not in `config/loader.ts`
 *
 * It was there, and persisting the result pushed that file past its god-file freeze (764 → 772). The ratchet's
 * instruction is to put new behaviour beside a large file rather than inside it, and this is not
 * configuration-loading behaviour: it is a token migration that happens to run at boot. The loader keeps one call.
 *
 * ## Why it writes to disk
 *
 * Owner ruling, 2026-08-13: *"translate old tokens into matrix rights and overwrite on update. only matrix from
 * now on."*
 *
 * In-memory derivation meant the matrix was never the record of record — recomputed on every boot from fields
 * that were still authoritative, so nobody could tell a token that had been migrated from one nobody had looked
 * at. Written down, "this token has no matrix" means something is wrong rather than something is old.
 *
 * A boot migration is the right shape here at all only because tokens are LOCAL state: `config.json` does not
 * sync. Synced data must be migrated lazily and self-healingly instead.

/**
 * Bring every MALFORMED rights object back to the validated shape, and say how many needed it.
 *
 * ## Why this is a second pass and not a stronger `if` in the backfill above
 *
 * `backfillTokenRights` skips on `if (t.rights) continue;` — the PRESENCE of a matrix, with no look at its
 * SHAPE. That is correct for what it does, and it is exactly why a token carrying a malformed matrix was never
 * repaired at any boot, for ever: the migration ran, saw an object, and moved on. The owner's report reads as
 * *"the migration didn't work"* for that reason.
 *
 * Keeping the two apart also keeps the promise the backfill's tests pin: it must NEVER overwrite a matrix
 * somebody set. Widening that function's condition to "present and well-formed" would have made one function
 * responsible for both "derive from legacy" and "do not lose an operator's edit", and the repair below is the
 * half that must not reach for the legacy fields at all.
 *
 * A token whose `rights` is not an object has nothing to preserve, so that one — and only that one — is
 * re-derived from the legacy fields.

/**
 * The boot step: derive and repair, IN MEMORY, and write nothing.
 *
 * ## It has no save path, and that is the fix rather than an omission
 *
 * `loadConfig` states the decision this obeys: *"IN MEMORY ONLY, and deliberately not persisted:
 * enforcement still reads the legacy fields, so this run is an observation rather than a change. Writing
 * it to config.json would make a derivation defect durable before anything has compared it against the
 * behaviour it is meant to reproduce."* The durable-migration gate exempts this function in those words,
 * and `a-token-without-a-matrix-reaches-nothing.test.js` describes it the same way.
 *
 * **The code did the opposite of all three.** It resolved `persist = save ?? defaultSave` and called it
 * whenever it had derived or repaired anything, so every boot ATTEMPTED the write the design forbids.
 *
 * **It was in-memory only by ACCIDENT.** `defaultSave` reached for `require('../config/loader.js')` to
 * keep the import graph one-way, and `server/package.json` is `"type": "module"`, where `require` does
 * not exist. So the call threw, the `catch` logged *"Could not persist derived token rights (will retry
 * next boot)"*, and the boot carried on — every boot, for ever, on every instance. It is in any preflight
 * log.
 *
 * ## Why fixing the obvious thing would have been the defect
 *
 * The warning names a recovery that cannot happen: *retry next boot* is not a retry when the failure is a
 * missing language feature, and it reads like a full disk. Anyone repairing it the obvious way — swapping
 * the `require` for a real import — would have silently INVERTED a deliberate decision, starting to write
 * a derivation to `config.json` before it had ever been compared against the enforcement it reproduces.
 * That is the exact outcome the loader's comment exists to prevent, arrived at by someone fixing an
 * unrelated-looking error.
 *
 * **So the `save?` parameter is gone too.** An injectable save is a save path with the safety catch off:
 * the next caller passes one and the decision above is reversed at a call site, where no reviewer is
 * looking for it.
 *
 * `D-2` is where persistence arrives, deliberately, once the scoping has been unified onto
 * `reachesSpace`/`memberSpacesForRequest` and the derived matrix has been shown to reproduce it.
