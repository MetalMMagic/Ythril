/**
 * A loop that calls a model inside one job step must report progress and must stop when its lease is gone.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `worker.ts` builds both halves — a `heartbeat` that stamps job progress and reports whether the claim is
 * still ours, and a `leaseLost` flag the long phases poll — and passed them **only** to the document pipeline.
 * `embedImage`, `embedAudio` and `embedVideo` got neither.
 *
 * One of the three mattered, and it is the only one that calls a model repeatedly inside a single step:
 *
 * - **The stall floor was fifty-three times short.** `extractKeyframes` writes `frame_%06d.jpg` with no cap,
 *   one frame per 30 s of footage. An hour of video is 120 captions; at the 120 s vision budget that is
 *   14 400 s inside a step reporting no progress at all, against a 270 s floor.
 * - **And the recovered job ran twice.** Stall recovery clears the claim token, so the sweep handed the file to
 *   a second worker — while nothing in the media path polled the lease, so the first run kept captioning. Two
 *   runs, same chunk ids, same GPU. `worker.ts` names that exact risk in the comment explaining why the
 *   document path polls.
 *
 * ## Why the rule is derived and not a list of three names
 *
 * A gate naming `embedVideo` goes stale the day a fourth media type is added, and the thing it would miss is
 * the same thing missed here — a new long loop nobody connected to the heartbeat. So the subject is computed:
 * **every `for` loop in the media path whose body awaits a provider call**. That set is one today. If it
 * becomes two, the second has to beat and stop or this fails.
 *
 * The sibling gates are complementary and none of them could have caught this one:
 * `stall-floor-covers-every-hop` asks whether each budget is KNOWN, `a-fallback-chain-is-one-hop` asks what one
 * hop COSTS, and this asks whether a step that exceeds any budget SAYS SO while it runs.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/a-model-loop-must-beat-and-stop.test.js
