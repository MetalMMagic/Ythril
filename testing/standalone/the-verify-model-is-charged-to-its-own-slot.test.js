/**
 * Every model slot the product declares is resolved by something.
 *
 * ## The hole this closes (`Q-8`)
 *
 * `docVerify` was declared in `MODEL_SLOTS`, given a default budget in `MODEL_SLOT_DEFAULT_MS`, accepted by
 * the admin PATCH, listed in `pinned-fields.ts` so infrastructure could fix it, and documented in the field
 * table an integrator reads. **No code resolved it.** The second-opinion pass runs against its own endpoint —
 * a deliberately different model — and charged everything to `docVlm`: its call budget, its egress permission
 * and, once that shipped, its reasoning effort.
 *
 * So an operator who set `modelSlots.docVerify.timeoutMs` because their verify model is slower got no effect
 * and no warning. The setting was accepted, stored, echoed back and pinnable. That is the failure shape this
 * repository keeps paying for: a control that looks applied and never was.
 *
 * ## Why this gate is derived rather than a test for one slot
 *
 * A test asserting "the verify call passes `docVerify`" would pass forever and say nothing about the
 * ELEVENTH slot somebody declares next year. The rule is that a declared slot has a reader, so the check
 * reads `MODEL_SLOTS` and looks for each name in the source that resolves slots. A slot added without a
 * reader fails here on the day it is added, which is the only day it is cheap to fix.

/**
 * The call shapes that RESOLVE a slot, as opposed to declaring one.
 *
 * The first version of this gate listed five files as "declaration only" and asked whether the slot appeared
 * anywhere else. It was already wrong when it was written: `model-egress-exposure.ts` maps each slot's
 * aliases, which is a sixth declaration, and that mention alone made the gate pass while the defect was
 * planted underneath it. A hand-maintained list of exemptions is precisely what this repository has a rule
 * against, and I wrote one anyway.
 *
 * So the question is inverted. Not *"does this name appear outside the places I thought of"* but *"is it
 * handed to something that uses it"* — one of the three resolvers, or a call site naming its own slot. A new
 * resolver needs a row here, which is a deliberate cost: one line, in the file that would otherwise quietly
 * stop covering it.
