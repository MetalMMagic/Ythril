/**
 * How a traversal narrows, and the Mongo predicate that applies it.
 *
 * ## Why its own module
 *
 * A-4 moved the recall seed traversal out of `edges.ts`, and this is the piece BOTH halves use: the standalone
 * `traverseGraph` stayed, `traverseFromSeeds` left, and each asks the same question of the same collection.
 *
 * It went sideways rather than travelling with either, for the reason `files-request.ts` records for the file
 * routes: taking a shared helper along leaves a copy behind, and one rule with two implementations is the
 * defect this codebase produces most. `frontierEdgeQuery` exists BECAUSE of that defect — it was written twice
 * and the copies disagreed, the standalone path honouring direction and labels while recall's did neither — so
 * duplicating it again during the extraction that separates its two callers would have been the same mistake a
 * second time.
 */

/**
 * How a traversal narrows: which edge labels it follows and which way.
 *
 * One shape, shared by the standalone `traverse` and by recall's expansion, because they were two
 * implementations of one rule and recall had the weaker — it followed EVERY edge in BOTH directions, with no
 * way for a caller to say otherwise. On a corpus where a few nodes hold most of the edges, that is the
 * difference between a deliberate neighbourhood and whichever neighbours the node cap happened to keep.
