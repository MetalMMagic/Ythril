/**
 * Every backup path honours the one encryption setting — enforced structurally, not by memory.
 *
 * The owner's requirement was *"settable on every backup option, infra as well as those in ui ... (consistent)"*,
 * and the risk is entirely in that last word: **an opt-in present on three of five paths is worse than none,
 * because the operator believes it is on.** Encryption you think you enabled is the failure mode this guards.
 *
 * It is affordable to guard because there is ONE choke point. `dumpDatabase` writes every backup and
 * `restoreDatabase` reads every one. So the gate is: nobody produces a backup any other way, and every caller
 * of the choke point passes the setting.
 *
 * Comments are stripped before matching. Six gates in this repo have fired on the comment explaining their own
 * fix, and the comments above the call sites below quote the very patterns asserted on.

 * real code with it. The gate then reported that file as having no `dumpDatabase(` call at all — a false PASS
 * on the very assertion it exists to make, which is worse than a false failure.
 *
