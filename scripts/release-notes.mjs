/**
 * Print the CHANGELOG body for a version, for `gh release create --notes-file`.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/release-notes.mjs 3.1.0 [out.md]
 *
 * Exits non-zero and says why when the section is missing or empty, so `publish.yml` fails loudly rather
 * than creating a Release with an empty body. A release note that says nothing is worse than a missing one:
 * it asserts that nothing changed.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * `publish.yml` pushed images on every `v*` tag and created no GitHub Release, and nothing noticed for six
 * versions — `v2.6.0` through `v3.0.1` shipped as images while the Releases page showed **2.5.1 as Latest
 * for five weeks**. The images were the half a machine consumes and the Release is the half a person reads,
 * and only one of them had a mechanism.

 * THERE IS A CEILING AS WELL AS A FLOOR, and only the floor existed.

 * with `422 body is too long (maximum is 125000 characters)` against 335 002 characters of notes.
 *
 * A major is where it breaks — 4.0.0 carries every entry since 3.0.0 — and the failure lands at the LAST
 * step, after everything else has published, which is the most expensive place for it to land.
