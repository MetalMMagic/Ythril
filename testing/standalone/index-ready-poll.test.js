/**
 * The index-readiness poll must list search indexes UNFILTERED and match by name.
 *
 * ## The evidence
 *
 * A deployment reported **~67 seconds per index on an instance with almost no data** — the same cost as
 * one with thirteen full spaces. Five spaces in, 24 indexes, ~27 minutes. A build that is genuinely
 * instant cannot take a fixed 67s. That is the 60s timeout expiring every single time, which means the
 * poll never observed READY at all, on indexes that were fine.
 *
 * The cause is one overload. `ensureVectorIndex` lists **without** a filter and finds by name, and that
 * call demonstrably works — it is how an existing index is detected for the update path. The two callers
 * that used `listSearchIndexes(indexName)` are exactly the two that misbehaved:
 *
 *   - `pollVectorIndexReady` — never saw READY, so every wait ran to timeout.
 *   - `pipeline-status` — `found[0]?.status` was always null, and `deriveLiveIndexState` turns a null
 *     status into **missing**, so the Indexing panel declared every index absent on a healthy instance.
 *
 * Listing all and matching by name is a strict superset of the filtered behaviour, so it cannot be worse
 * on a deployment where the filter did work.
 *
 * ## Why a source-level gate
 *
 * Reproducing it needs a live mongot that behaves this way, which CI's Atlas Local may or may not. The
 * regression is a one-token change back to the filtered overload, and its symptom is a *slow* run rather
 * than a failing one — the signature that let it survive two rounds of investigation.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/index-ready-poll.test.js

/**
 * The probe asks about the field the index INDEXES, and at the width it was BUILT at.
 *
 * ## The defect, and how a passing spec hid it
 *
 * `indexServes` hardcoded `path: 'embedding'` and took its width from `getEmbeddingConfig().dimensions`.
 * Correct for the five text indexes. Wrong for the face gallery, which indexes `faceEmbedding` at 128. So on
 * every space, every second, for the full 600 s window:
 *
 *     Vector search index <space>_files_faceEmbedding: gave up after 600s
 *       — probe did not serve: ... :: caused by :: embedding is not indexed as vector
 *
 * **The probe could not succeed, so its answer carried no information.** The canary operator read those lines
 * off a live pod on 2026-08-20, concluded no face index had ever been built, and stopped a configuration
 * change on it. The index may have been READY the whole time.
 *
 * The test above asserted the probe was "a real vector query, against the named index, cheap". All three were
 * true. None of them is the question. That is why this block asserts the FIELD and the WIDTH, and asserts them
 * per call site rather than once: the bug was not in the probe's shape, it was in what two callers failed to
 * tell it.
 *
 * `ensureVectorSearchIndex` had both values — it built the definition from them — and did not pass them on.
 * Worth naming as a shape: the caller held the answer and the callee guessed.
