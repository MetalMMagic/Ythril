/**
 * The tombstone prune floor — every branch that decides whether a deletion record may be dropped.
 *
 * ## Why this is the test that matters
 *
 * Tombstones had no retention bound at all, and the obvious fix — delete them after N days — is wrong in a way
 * that only shows up weeks later. They are served by `seq > sinceSeq`, so a peer that was offline longer than
 * the window comes back, never learns of the deletion, and pushes its live copy: the retention fix turns into
 * "deleted records keep coming back", with nothing left to point at.
 *
 * So the floor is built from what peers have provably been served, and **every unknown must resolve to "keep"**.
 * That asymmetry is the whole design: keeping a tombstone too long costs a few hundred bytes, dropping one too
 * early resurrects a deleted record. The cases below are that asymmetry, one branch at a time — all pure, so
 * none of them needs a database or a config file.
 *
 * Mutation-checked in both spellings of the defect:
 *   - floor too HIGH (`Math.max` instead of the minimum, or ignoring a member with no record) → a tombstone a
 *     peer still needs is deleted. Caught by "the minimum wins" and "a member that never pulled blocks".
 *   - floor absent (treating "no members" as "no peers") → the whole collection goes on an instance a peer
 *     token can still read. Caught by the peer-token cases.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/tombstone-floor.test.js
