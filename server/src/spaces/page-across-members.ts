/**
 * One paging rule for every listing that spans the members of a proxy space.
 *
 * ## Why this is a shared function and not a pattern to copy
 *
 * `/query` shipped its own version of this in 2.8.0 and got it wrong: it fetched a window capped at 100 rows and then
 * sliced it at `skip`, so every page past row 100 came back EMPTY while the response's own `total` reported the true
 * count. A caller sweeping a large collection stopped silently at 100.
 *
 * The embed-job listing then needed the same paging, and copying the shape would have meant two implementations of one
 * rule — this codebase's most repeated defect, with the weaker copy winning silently. So the rule lives here and both
 * callers pass their own fetch function.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * **One member: push `skip` down to the database.** Correct at any depth, no window, no slicing. This is the case for
 * every non-proxy space, which is nearly every request.
 *
 * **Several members: fetch `skip + limit` from each, merge, sort, take the window.** Rows `[skip, skip+limit)` of a merged
 * set genuinely require `skip + limit` from every member — there is no way to know which member holds row 200 without
 * reading the first 200 of each. That multiplies, so it is bounded, and exceeding the bound is an explicit refusal rather
 * than the empty page that made this necessary.

   * For the single-member case `skip` is the caller's skip; for the merge it is 0 and `limit` is `skip + limit`.
   *
   * Named `readMember` rather than `fetch`: in this codebase `fetch` means HTTP egress, and the egress gate reads it that
   * way — it flagged this file the moment it existed. A name that misleads a gate misleads a reader too.
