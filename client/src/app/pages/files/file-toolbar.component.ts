/**

 * belongs with the renderer, and there is exactly one of it. The page still BUILDS the trail — the
 * accumulator is one of only two places that construct a path, and `join` is the other.

/**
 * The toolbar above the listing: where you are, and the four things you can do from here.
 *
 * `G-3.3`. The space selector, the breadcrumb trail, the new-folder form, the upload picker and the sidebar
 * toggle — one strip of controls that share a row and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Dumb, like every other child on this page
 *
 * `input()` for what to draw, `model()` for the form state the page needs to see, `output()` for a gesture.
 * The page decides what a click MEANS: `navigate` also refills the tree, `createFolder` goes through the
 * listing store and may be refused, and `toggleSidebar` belongs to the tree store.
 *
 * **The new-folder form is `model()` and not local state, and that is load-bearing.** A refused create has
 * to keep what was typed — losing an edit to a failed request is the one outcome trying again cannot undo —
 * so the page closes the form on the ANSWER, not on the attempt. If this component owned `open` outright it
 * would have to be told the outcome, which is a second channel for a decision the page already makes. A
 * characterization case has stood over that rule since the eighth cut.
 *
 * ## The file input clears itself
 *
 * A file input fires `change` only when its value CHANGES, so leaving it set makes picking the same file
 * twice silent — no row, no upload, and nothing on screen to explain it. The clearing happens here because
 * the element is here; what the files MEAN is the page's, which is why the output carries them on.
