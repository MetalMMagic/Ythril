/**
 * Every JSON API route returns `{ error }` — and the two surfaces that deliberately do not are named.
 *
 * ## The stated contract
 *
 * `docs/integration-guide/03-auth-and-limits.md`, under **Error Format**:
 *
 * > All errors return JSON:
 * > `{ "error": "Human-readable message" }`
 *
 * ## The finding was the documentation, not the code
 *
 * The contract is held everywhere it should be — every route handler, the API 404, all six rate limiters (each
 * with `message: { error }` and a handler that JSONs it), and the global error middleware. Two surfaces return
 * something else, **both correctly**:
 *
 *  - `api/metrics.ts` — a `401` and a `500` as Prometheus comment lines. A scraper does not parse JSON, and `#`
 *    is a comment in the exposition format, so the error degrades into something the consumer can read.
 *  - `setup/routes.ts` — a `404` and a `400` as text/HTML. First-run setup is a server-rendered flow that exists
 *    *before* the SPA does; its consumer is a browser, and a JSON body would render as raw text.
 *
 * So "all errors return JSON" was simply false, and the fix was to say what is actually true. The word "all" in a
 * contract is the part an integrator relies on.
 *
 * ## Why the gate is the more valuable half
 *
 * The two exceptions are fine. A **third** one appearing without anybody deciding it should is not — that is how
 * a contract erodes: each individual case is defensible in isolation, and no one is looking at the set. This gate
 * makes the exemption list the place that decision has to be written down.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/error-shape-is-json.test.js
