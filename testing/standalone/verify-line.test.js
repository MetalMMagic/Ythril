/**
 * A tracker item's `Verify:` line is checkable, and the check agrees with the shell it is written for.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists to prevent, measured rather than argued
 *
 * The obvious implementation matches the pattern literally. On this tree that silently disagrees with grep:
 *
 *     grep -c "^export" server/src/brain/edges.ts   → 24   what the author sees in Git Bash
 *     literal substring count                       →  0   what a naive matcher answers
 *
 * The divergence runs toward **0**, and `returns 0` is what every clause in the corpus asserts. So the gate
 * would report the evidence intact while the author, hand-checking the identical line in the shell it names,
 * sees 24 and believes the row carries real evidence. Both wrong, in the same direction, quietly.
 *
 * Interpreting the pattern as a regex instead is worse: `new RegExp` would hand an unreviewed string from a
 * gitignored file to V8's backtracking engine, which has no timeout in JavaScript — measured on this machine,
 * `new RegExp('(a+)+b').test('a'.repeat(40))` runs for **119 seconds**. So the pattern is REFUSED when it
 * contains a character grep would read as an operator, and the author rewrites it as a literal.
 *
 * ## The other direction matters just as much
 *
 * `( ) { } | + ?` are ORDINARY characters in a basic regular expression — grep only treats them as operators
 * when backslash-escaped, and the backslash is refused. Rejecting them would push authors toward vaguer
 * patterns, and a vaguer pattern matches a neighbour of its subject, which is the failure the whole check
 * exists to catch. Both directions are asserted below.
 *
 * ## What a green result MEANS
 *
 * "Its stated evidence still holds" — never "it is still open". They differ whenever a fix lands somewhere
 * other than the file the row names, which here is the usual shape, because the convention is to extract.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/verify-line.test.js
