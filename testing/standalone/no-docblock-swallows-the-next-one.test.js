/**
 * A `/**` that meets another `/**` before it closes has swallowed everything between them.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `types-knowledge.ts` carried an unclosed docblock: the `*​/` went out with the field it described
 * (`tagSuggestions`, removed in #894) and the opener stayed. The next `/** … *​/` down the file terminated it,
 * so the field AFTER that — `propertySchemas`, one of the most-read fields in the schema model — was
 * documented as **"RETIRED — read and written, consumed by nothing."**
 *
 * It reached the emitted declarations too, so an editor's hover said the same thing.
 *
 * ## Why nothing caught it
 *
 * Every gate that reads these interfaces strips comments first — correctly, because they are checking code.
 * `documented-interfaces-match-code.test.js` does exactly that, and it is right to. **A comment defect is
 * invisible to every check that removes comments before looking**, which is the whole class, so it needs a
 * check that reads them on purpose.
 *
 * A brace or paren counter would not find it either: the file parses, compiles and lints. The only symptom is
 * that a human reads the wrong sentence about the right field.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * Scanning left to right outside strings: after a `/**` the next thing must be its own `*​/`. Meeting a second
 * opener first means the first block never closed, and every field between the two is documented by whatever
 * that block says.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/no-docblock-swallows-the-next-one.test.js
