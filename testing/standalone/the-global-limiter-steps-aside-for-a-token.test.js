/**
 * A per-token rate limit above 300/min can actually take effect.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `rateLimitPerMinute` is a real per-token field: validated once for both doors by `rateLimitRefusal`, with
 * `YTHRIL_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` as an instance ceiling, and enforced by `tokenRateLimit` — which IS mounted,
 * inside `requireAuth`, where the token record finally exists to read the number off.
 *
 * `globalRateLimit` was never moved. It stayed a literal `max: 300` on 171 routes, and
 * `clientRateLimitKey` keys it on a **hash of the presented credential** — so a token got its own 300 bucket
 * there, and the effective limit was `min(300, whatever was set)`. Granting 1 000 changed nothing, while
 * `GET /api/tokens` reported `rateLimitEffective: 1000`.
 *
 * Three numbers for one quota: what an admin set, what the API echoed, and what was enforced.
 *
 * ## The decision, and why it does not weaken anything
 *
 * Owner, 2026-08-30: the global limiter **steps aside once a credential is presented**, leaving the per-token
 * quota as the only limit on authenticated traffic — which is what that quota was built to be.
 *
 * It cannot literally wait for the token to RESOLVE: it runs pre-auth by mount order, and `attachToken`'s own
 * docblock says the limit *"cannot be applied any earlier than this"* because until the record is resolved
 * there is nothing to read it from. So the test is the credential, and the two outcomes are both covered:
 *
 *  - it resolves → `tokenRateLimit` governs, with the number the operator actually set;
 *  - it does not → `requireAuth` answers 401, and a FLOOD of invented credentials is exactly what
 *    `ipFloodBackstop` exists for. Its own docblock: *"every distinct bearer string mints a fresh bucket, so
 *    a flood of random credentials would never hit a limit. This limiter closes that."*
 *
 * That last point is what makes this safe rather than a trade: `globalRateLimit` never bounded a rotating
 * attacker either, because it is keyed per credential too. It only ever bounded the honest caller.
 *
 * ## What 4.0 had to fix about it
 *
 * The skip made the definition of "a credential" load-bearing, and that definition used to include a raw
 * `?token=` query parameter — needed while the MCP SSE transport authenticated that way. Nothing checked
 * that parameter, so `?token=anything` was enough to switch the limiter off and drop an anonymous caller
 * onto the flood backstop instead. Removing the SSE transport removed the fallback, and the case below
 * pins the two together: a rate-limit skip must never be reachable by something that fails authentication.
 *
