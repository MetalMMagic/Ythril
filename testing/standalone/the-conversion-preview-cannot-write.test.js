/**
 * The migration preview reads, and there is no path through it that writes.
 *
 * ## What it is for (`Q-15`)
 *
 * An operator asked to convert live data to link records had not run it, and said why: they could not see
 * the scale of it beforehand, the 400 that follows lands on some other service's next write, and nothing
 * anywhere said whether it could be undone. *"An operator who believes a step is irreversible defers it,
 * which is what we are doing."*
 *
 * `--preview` is the answer to the first of those. It is only an answer while it is TRUE that it writes
 * nothing — a preview an operator does not trust is worse than none, because it costs the trust of
 * everything printed beside it.
 *
 * ## Why an ALLOWLIST of reads rather than a list of writes
 *
 * A list of forbidden calls — `insertOne`, `updateMany`, `bulkWrite` — is a list somebody has to keep
 * complete against a driver they do not own, and the day it misses one is the day it passes over the defect.
 * See *A gate concludes about MORE than it checks* in `CLAUDE.md`.
 *
 * So this inverts it: the preview may call `countDocuments` and `aggregate` on a collection, and nothing
 * else. A new call fails here until somebody looks at it, which for this function is exactly the review
 * that should happen.
 *
 * `aggregate` gets its own case, because two of its stages write — `$out` and `$merge` — and a pipeline is
 * the one place a "read" method is not one.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/the-conversion-preview-cannot-write.test.js
