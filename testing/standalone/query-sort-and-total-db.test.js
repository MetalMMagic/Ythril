/**
 * `/query` orders by a caller-chosen field and reports the MATCH TOTAL — against a real MongoDB.
 *
 * ## The ask
 *
 * aigents, 2026-08-11T1045Z, alongside the `skip` finding: `sort` on `/query`, and an explicit way to fetch everything.
 * #863 honoured `skip` and turned `sort` from silently ignored into an explicit `400` naming it — the right direction, and
 * still not the thing they asked for.
 *
 * ## Why `total` is the more important half
 *
 * `count` on the response is the PAGE length. A caller sweeping with `skip` cannot distinguish a short last page from a
 * truncated one without an extra request that returns nothing — so the total was the number they were computing by hand,
 * which is how it got fabricated in the first place.
 *
 * ## What the sort has to preserve
 *
 * Paging works because the order is TOTAL: `_id` breaks every tie, so no row drifts between pages. A caller-supplied sort
 * that dropped that would re-create the original defect on a different axis, so `toMongoSort` appends `_id` and the
 * assertions below page through a custom order and demand the same tiling property as the default one.
 *
 * And the proxy merge comparator is built FROM the sort handed to MongoDB. The previous version hardcoded the default
 * keys, which was correct only while `/query` had no `sort`: the moment a caller could choose, a proxy space would have
 * merged its members by the old order and returned a page in an order nobody asked for.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:up` first, then
 *      node --test testing/standalone/query-sort-and-total-db.test.js
 * (requires a prior `npm run build` in server/)
