/**
 * A config write through a NESTED reference is lost if a reload lands first.
 *
 * ## Where this came from
 *
 * `loader.ts` mutates the top-level config object in place on reload, precisely so that a handler holding
 * `const cfg = getConfig()` across an await still saves onto fresh data. Its own comment names the leak in
 * that scheme:
 *
 *   > a reference held to a NESTED object (a single `space` out of `cfg.spaces`) is still detached, because
 *   > the arrays are replaced wholesale. Those sites are listed in ARCHITECTURE-TODO and want `mutateConfig`.
 *
 * They were not listed — the item had been dropped from that file while the code kept pointing at it.
 * Found 2026-08-01 by grepping source TODO markers rather than trusting the tracker.
 *
 * ## Why it is not theoretical, which is what had to be established first
 *
 * A reload happens at RUNTIME from three places, and two of them are reachable by a **remote peer**:
 * the config-file watcher (`applyConfigFromDisk`), `POST /api/sync/members`, and `POST /api/sync/votes`.
 * So a peer casting a vote can reload the config while a local network join is awaiting a bcrypt hash —
 * and every site that matches the dangerous shape is in exactly that code (two in `networks/join.ts`, one
 * in the token prefix backfill).
 *
 * ## What this pins
 *
 * The loss itself, against the real loader — no server, no Mongo. Then that `mutateConfig` is the fix, so
 * the repair is demonstrated rather than asserted. The scan for the SHAPE lives in the same suite, so a new
 * site cannot appear without failing here.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/stale-nested-config-ref.test.js
