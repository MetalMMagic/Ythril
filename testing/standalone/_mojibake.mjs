/**
 * Structural detection of cp1252-mis-decoded UTF-8, replacing a hand-written list of signatures.
 *
 * ## Why the list had to go
 *
 * The gate matched `â€`, `â”` and `â•` — the openings of mis-decoded U+20xx punctuation and U+25xx box
 * drawing, each added after being found in the tree. It reported clean while `server/src/api/tokens.ts` still
 * carried `Ã—`, the double-encoding of `×`, because that starts with `Ã` and is only TWO characters long.
 *
 * Two misses from the same cause: the pattern named the instances somebody had already tripped over, so every
 * new shape of the same defect was invisible until it bit. A gate that enumerates its enemies is a gate that
 * is always one behind.
 *
 * ## What replaces it
 *
 * The structural question. Take a run of adjacent non-ASCII characters and encode it back to cp1252 — the
 * codepage the corruption came from. If those bytes are valid UTF-8 AND decode to something SHORTER than the
 * run, the run is mis-decoded text: three characters that were one, or two that were one.
 *
 * Correct text does not do that. `×` is a single character with no preceding partner; `—` likewise. Their
 * cp1252 bytes are `0xD7` and — for a real em-dash — not representable in a way that forms a valid multibyte
 * sequence. The shortening requirement is what makes this safe: a conversion that keeps or grows the length
 * is not a repair, so it is refused.
 *
 * ## The table is explicit on purpose
 *
 * A positional string literal for the 0x80–0x9F block put a repair off by four bytes and turned an em dash
 * into U+2010 without failing anything. Byte→codepoint pairs cannot shift.
