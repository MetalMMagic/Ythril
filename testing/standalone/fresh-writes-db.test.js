/**
 * The scan that sees what the vector index has not.
 *
 * `matchFreshWrites` is the half of `checkDuplicates` that reads the COLLECTION. It exists because every
 * path through `$vectorSearch` inherits the index's lag — including `exact: true`, which is an exhaustive
 * scan of the index rather than of the collection. Measured on this stack: ANN first saw a fresh write
 * after 1088 ms, ENN after 1083 ms.
 *
 * Two things need pinning, and only a real database can pin either.
 *
 *  1. **The score.** The pipeline computes `dot` and the document's norm in MQL; JS maps those through
 *     `atlasScoreFromParts`. That split only holds while the MQL arithmetic agrees with the JS arithmetic,
 *     and no fixture can check that — a hand-written expectation would just be the same belief twice.
 *  2. **The bounds.** A scan on a write path that is not bounded is a production incident waiting for a
 *     large space. The window and the cap are the bounds, and both are only observable against real data.
 *
 * No vector index and no embedding server here: this path uses neither, and a test that stood one up would
 * be slower and would say less.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:up` first, then
 *      node --test testing/standalone/fresh-writes-db.test.js
 * (requires a prior `npm run build` in server/)
