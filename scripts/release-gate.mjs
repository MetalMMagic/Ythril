/**
 * The documentation release gate.
 *
 * Owner rule, 2026-08-04: *"i want the documentation lens to be a release gate from now on. docs/ MUST match code
 * and changelog must be carrying and notice MUST contain all attribution."*
 *
 * ## Why this is a RELEASE gate and not just more CI
 *
 * The individual coverage gates already run per PR. What nothing checked was **the tag itself**. A tag push goes
 * straight to `publish.yml`, so the sequence "cut the tag → build → push to two registries" had no documentation
 * precondition at all. Every one of these three failures could have shipped:
 *
 *  - a version tagged with `[Unreleased]` still holding the entries, so the released CHANGELOG section is empty
 *    and every change in the release is filed under a heading that does not exist yet;
 *  - a version tagged where the four manifests disagree, so the image reports one number and the notes another;
 *  - a dependency added and attributed nowhere, published to two public registries under a licence that requires
 *    attribution.
 *
 * The per-PR gates catch the second and third *eventually*. A release is the moment they stop being recoverable:
 * an image on GHCR and Docker Hub cannot be un-published, and a missing attribution in a shipped artefact is a
 * licence problem rather than a tidiness one.
 *
 * ## What it enforces, in the owner's three terms
 *
 *  1. **docs/ MUST match code** — every documentation-coverage gate, plus markdownlint.
 *  2. **CHANGELOG must be carrying** — this version has a dated section, that section has real content, and
 *     `[Unreleased]` has been emptied into it.
 *  3. **NOTICE MUST contain all attribution** — every direct dependency of the redistributed trees.
 *
 * Run: `npm run release:gate`
 * Also runs in `publish.yml` BEFORE the build, so a bad tag fails in seconds instead of publishing.

 * One version, in every manifest.

 * after publish), while the CHANGELOG heading and the git tag come from elsewhere. A disagreement means the
 * artefact and its notes describe different releases, and the pull that proves the release is fine passes anyway.
 */
/**
 * A stored shape that only a 4.x peer understands may not ship under a 3.x version.
 *
 * `D-6` removed the legacy `excludeFromVectorSearch` spelling of the per-record never-embed mark. A peer
 * below 3.1.0 does not know the current spelling, strips it on ingest, and replicates its unsuppressed
 * copy onward — so content an author marked never-embed reaches an embedding model and returns to ranked
 * search, silently, on every instance.
 *
 * The peer floor is this instance's own MAJOR, so a 4.x build refuses every 3.x peer and the hazard
 * cannot occur. A 3.x build's floor is 3.0.0, which admits exactly the peer that strips it.
 *
 * ## Why this lives at the TAG and not in the test suite
 *
 * It was an always-on gate first, and that was wrong: it made the development tree — 3.4.0 with the key
 * removed — permanently red, for a hazard that needs a RELEASE to reach anybody. Owner, 2026-09-05:
 * *"no it does not need a second bound. there will not be a release before 4.0 so it doesnt matter"*.
 *
 * He is right, and the check belongs where the assumption is actually tested: the moment a tag is cut. A
 * gate that fires during development for a risk that only exists at release teaches people to weaken it.
