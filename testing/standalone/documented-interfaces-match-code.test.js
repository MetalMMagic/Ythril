/**
 * An interface block in the docs must list the same fields as the interface it copies.
 *
 * ## The failure this catches, reported from outside
 *
 * `06-spaces-api.md` documents `TypeSchema` as a TypeScript block. It listed three fields. The real
 * interface has five public ones — `$ref` and `retention` were missing, and `retention` had been shipped,
 * built an editor in the admin UI, and documented **in a different file** (`04-brain-api.md`).
 *
 * An integrator re-ingesting the guides on every deploy asked whether per-type retention was documented
 * "anywhere we have not looked", because their recall over `06-spaces-api.md` could not surface a field
 * that file never named. They were right, and they were careful enough to ask rather than announce it.
 * The reason it matters to them specifically is the mirror image of this bug: they had once written a
 * `PATCH` against `chronoRetention`, a key the docs described and the implementation never shipped — and a
 * deep-merge `PATCH` against a key that does not exist returns success and changes nothing.
 *
 * ## Why no existing gate caught it
 *
 * Every docs-coverage gate here asks whether a thing is MENTIONED. `retention` **was** mentioned, in
 * `04-brain-api.md`, so those gates were satisfied and correct to be. What nothing checked was the second
 * copy: an interface block is a duplicate of a type declaration, and duplicates drift. Drift needs two
 * copies compared, not one copy counted.
 *
 * A prose omission is a gap. An **enumeration** that omits something is worse — it reads as complete, so it
 * does not invite the question that a gap does. That is the whole reason this gate compares in both
 * directions: a documented field that no longer exists is the same defect wearing the other hat, and it is
 * the one that produces a silent no-op `PATCH`.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/documented-interfaces-match-code.test.js
