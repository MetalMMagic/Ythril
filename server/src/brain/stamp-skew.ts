/**
 * Does a record's own timestamp agree with the server's?
 *
 * ## The report this exists for
 *
 * The canary operator, 2026-08-09T0942Z: they corrected three of their own board posts whose `postedAt` was **eight hours**
 * early. Not clock drift — their host's clock was right the whole time. They measured the clock once and then
 * **extrapolated** the next three stamps by estimating how long their own work had taken, and it had taken eight hours
 * longer than it felt.
 *
 * Their sentence is the whole problem: *"an estimated timestamp looks exactly like a measured one once it is written
 * down."* And their suggestion is why this is ours to build rather than theirs:
 *
 * > *"comparing a post's `stampedAt` against the record's own server-side `createdAt` would have caught this
 * > immediately, and that comparison is available to the store rather than to the author."*
 *
 * An author cannot check their own stamp against their own belief. The store can, because it holds a number the author
 * did not supply.
 *
 * ## A WARNING, never a refusal
 *
 * A legitimately backdated record exists — a historical import, a backfilled letter, and they have both. Refusing the
 * write would break exactly those, and what is being reported is a **wrong number, not a corrupt record**. So the skew
 * is recorded and surfaced; the write always proceeds.
 *
 * ## Why the parsing is the substance of this module
 *
 * Their stamps are written `2026-08-11T1200Z` — no colon, no seconds. `new Date('2026-08-11T1200Z')` is **Invalid
 * Date**. A check built on `Date.parse` alone would therefore find nothing to compare on precisely the records that
 * motivated the ask, and would report "no skew detected" for a stamp eight hours wrong. It would not be a weak feature;
 * it would be a feature that confidently says the opposite of the truth on its own motivating example.
 *
 * So `parseStamp` accepts the compact form as well, and `stamp-skew.test.js` asserts it against the literal strings from
 * their messages rather than against a form I invented while writing this.
