/**
 * The token rights derivation is in-memory only — and it must be so BY CONSTRUCTION, not by accident.
 *
 * ## What was actually happening
 *
 * Three places say this migration never writes to disk. `loadConfig`'s own comment: *"IN MEMORY ONLY, and
 * deliberately not persisted: enforcement still reads the legacy fields, so this run is an observation
 * rather than a change. Writing it to config.json would make a derivation defect durable before anything
 * has compared it against the behaviour it is meant to reproduce."* The durable-migration gate exempts it
 * in as many words. And `a-token-without-a-matrix-reaches-nothing.test.js` describes it the same way.
 *
 * The code did the opposite. `migrateTokenRightsOnBoot` resolved `persist = save ?? defaultSave` and called
 * it whenever it had derived or repaired anything — so every boot ATTEMPTED the write the design forbids.
 *
 * **It was in-memory only by accident.** `defaultSave` reached for `require('../config/loader.js')` to keep
 * the import graph one-way, and `server/package.json` is `"type": "module"`, where `require` does not
 * exist. So the call threw, the surrounding `catch` logged *"Could not persist derived token rights (will
 * retry next boot)"*, and the boot carried on. Every boot, for ever, on every instance.
 *
 * ## Why that is worse than an ordinary bug, and why fixing the obvious thing would have been the defect
 *
 * The warning names a recovery that cannot happen — *retry next boot* is not a retry when the failure is
 * a missing language feature. It reads like a full disk. And anyone who "fixed" it the obvious way, by
 * swapping the `require` for a real import, would have silently INVERTED a deliberate decision: the
 * derivation would start being written to `config.json` before it had ever been compared against the
 * enforcement it is meant to reproduce, which is the exact outcome the loader's comment exists to prevent.
 *
 * So the fix is to make the stated design true: this function does not write, and cannot be asked to.
 *
 * ## What this gate holds
 *
 * That the in-memory promise is structural. Not "the save path is currently broken" — no save path.
 * `D-2` is where persisting happens, deliberately, once the comparison it waits on has been done.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/the-rights-derivation-really-is-in-memory-only.test.js
