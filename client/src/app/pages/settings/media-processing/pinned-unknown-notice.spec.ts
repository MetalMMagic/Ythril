/**
 * An unrecognised pin is shown where an operator will see it, and nothing is shown when there is none.
 *
 * ## What this protects
 *
 * `YTHRIL_PINNED_FIELDS` fixes a field at whatever it resolves to. Its one dangerous failure is a typo: the
 * operator believes a control is locked and it is not. The server reports those entries as `pinnedUnknown` rather
 * than only logging them, and this notice is the half that makes that reach a person — a warning in the server log
 * is the one place they are not reading.
 *
 * Two things are asserted that a screenshot cannot: that it renders **nothing** on a healthy instance, and that it
 * sits on the PAGE above the tab panel rather than inside one tab. The second matters because the variable names
 * fields across all three tabs, so putting the notice in one of them would hide it from an operator who opened
 * another.
 *
 * Run: npm run test:client
