/**
 * Per-token MFA — the policy, and the escalation it must not allow.
 *
 * ## The reported problem
 *
 * `/api/mfa` is a single instance-wide `{ enabled }`. Turning it on makes every MFA-gated route demand a TOTP
 * code from every PAT, including the ones a scheduler holds — so **MFA is mutually exclusive with automation,
 * and the deployments most likely to want MFA are exactly the ones that have automation.** The ask was to make
 * it a token property, as read-only and space scoping already are.
 *
 * ## The two things worth pinning
 *
 * 1. **The policy itself.** Three states, both overrides, and `inherit` meaning precisely what an absent field
 *    means today — so no existing token changes behaviour.
 * 2. **An exemption must not be able to widen itself.** `POST /api/tokens` is guarded by `requireAdminMfa`,
 *    which an admin token that is ITSELF exempt satisfies with no code at all. Without a second rule, one
 *    exemption mints another, and another, until the instance-wide switch protects nothing. Granting an
 *    exemption therefore costs a live TOTP code regardless of who is asking.
 *
 * The second is asserted against the SOURCE as well as the helper, because the hole is opened by an ordering
 * mistake (checking after the write, or not at all on a future edit route) that a unit test of the predicate
 * cannot see.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/per-token-mfa.test.js
 * (requires a prior `npm run build` in server/ so server/dist exists)
