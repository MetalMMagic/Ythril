/**
 * Every token route a space-restricted administrator can reach narrows by the SAME rule.
 *
 * ## The gap
 *
 * `requireAdminOrSpaceAdminMfa` admits a space-restricted administrator — a token holding `admin` on all four
 * areas of one space. Three of the four token routes then narrow what it may touch:
 *
 *     GET    /api/tokens        filters the list by `editorScopeFor`
 *     POST   /api/tokens        refuses an out-of-scope grant at mint
 *     PATCH  /api/tokens/:id    runs `refusalsOutsideEditorScope`
 *     DELETE /api/tokens/:id    resolved no scope at all
 *
 * So an administrator of one space could **revoke any token on the instance**, instance-admin tokens included.
 * PATCH's own comment records what its guard exists to prevent — without it "such a token could rename any
 * token on the instance and write `rights.instanceAdmin` onto it" — and revoking is strictly more destructive
 * than renaming.
 *
 * One rule, four implementations, and the missing one on the most destructive verb. That is the defect
 * `CLAUDE.md` names as this repo's most-produced, arriving as an omission rather than as a weaker copy.
 *
 * ## Why the assertion is "all of them" and not "DELETE too"
 *
 * A test naming DELETE would have passed for every one of the five releases before the route existed, and will
 * pass again the day a fifth token route is added without a guard. The property is that the set of routes a
 * space admin can reach and the set that narrows are THE SAME SET, so the gate derives both.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/token-routes-narrow-by-one-rule.test.js
