/**
 * The modal shell: backdrop, panel, header.
 *
 * ## Why this is a shared constant and not six copies
 *
 * Angular component styles are SCOPED. `tokens.component.ts` defined `.dialog-backdrop` and `.dialog`, and
 * for as long as the create-token markup lived inside that component it was styled by them. Extracting the
 * dialog into its own component moved the markup and left the CSS behind — so the "dialog" rendered as a
 * plain block at the top of the page: full width, no backdrop, no centring, pushing the token list down.
 *
 * Nothing failed. The template compiled, the component rendered, every test passed, and the page was simply
 * wrong to look at. The owner found it, not the build: *"its also no pop-up"*.
 *
 * That is the failure mode of a per-component copy of shared CSS — it is invisible at the moment the markup
 * moves, which is exactly when it breaks. A constant both files import cannot be left behind by a move, and
 * `dialogs-carry-their-own-shell.test.js` fails any component that writes `.dialog-backdrop` in a template
 * without taking these rules with it.
 *
 * Sizing stays with the caller: dialogs legitimately differ in width (a confirm is not a schema editor), so
 * `--dialog-max-width` is a variable the host sets rather than a value baked in here.

  /* The third card surface, decorated on the same terms as .card and .modal in styles.scss — see the comment
     there for the whole argument.

     It has to be repeated here rather than covered by that rule, and that is the point of this file existing:
     these styles live in component style arrays, so Angular's emulated encapsulation scopes .dialog to the
     components that import THIS constant. A rule in the global sheet would never match it. Writing it here is
     what makes "three places, all global, none per-view" true of the decoration too.

     --bg-primary, not --bg-surface: a dialog's own base differs from a card's, and mixing the wrong one would
     make a decorated dialog a different shade from a decorated card.

     NOTE: no backticks anywhere in this file, including comments. It is one template literal, so a backtick ends
     the string and the error surfaces as "Failed to resolve styles at position 0", never here. */

   * THE SET-APART BLOCK, shared because two dialogs now need it and a copy would drift.
   *
   * It lived inline in token-rights-dialog alone. When the create dialog gained the same instance-level
   * flags, its markup used these class names and rendered COMPLETELY UNSTYLED — the create dialog imports
   * DIALOG_STYLES only, and Angular's per-component style encapsulation meant the other dialog's copy could
   * not reach it. That is the same defect as the schema property editor's lost stylesheet (#915): markup that
   * looks right in the diff and renders as unstyled text in the product.
   *
   * Only the CONTAINER and its heading move here. .danger-row/.danger-label/.danger-hint stay inline in
   * the rights dialog, because rotate and revoke exist nowhere else — a create form has nothing to rotate.
   *
   * Visually separated, and last. A destructive control beside Save is a mis-click; the reader should have to
   * travel to reach it. The border is the boundary, not decoration.
