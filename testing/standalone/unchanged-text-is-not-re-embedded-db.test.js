/**
 * A record whose embedded text did not change is not re-embedded.
 *
 * ## The waste
 *
 * Every successful update enqueues an embed job, unconditionally — which is right: the enqueue is also how the
 * `excludeFromVectorSearch` toggle takes effect, and it replaced four inline embeds built from stale reads. But
 * most updates change something the vector does not depend on. Editing a tag, a property, a link or a status paid
 * for a model call that could only reproduce the vector already stored.
 *
 * ## Why this is lossless rather than a heuristic
 *
 * A vector is a pure function of (text, model). Every embed already writes `matchedText` — the exact text it
 * embedded — beside the vector, so the fingerprint needed no new field and no migration of synced data. When the
 * newly built text equals `matchedText`, a vector is present, and the configured model is the one that produced
 * it, the model call cannot produce anything different.
 *
 * All three conditions are asserted here, each on its own, because it is the CONJUNCTION that makes the skip safe
 * and any one of them alone would make it a guess.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/unchanged-text-is-not-re-embedded-db.test.js
