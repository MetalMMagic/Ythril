/**
 * The release gate is itself testable, because a gate that cannot fail is worse than no gate.
 *
 * Owner rule, 2026-08-04: *"i want the documentation lens to be a release gate from now on. docs/ MUST match code
 * and changelog must be carrying and notice MUST contain all attribution."*
 *
 * `scripts/release-gate.mjs` runs at tag time — in `publish.yml`, before login and before the build. The three
 * things it protects are the three a published release can never take back: an image on two public registries,
 * notes that do not describe it, and an attribution that was owed and not given. So the gate has to be right, and
 * "it printed PASSED once" is not evidence of that.
 *
 * ## What these tests are for
 *
 * The gate's own logic is what nothing else covers. The coverage gates it *invokes* have their own tests; the
 * parts unique to a release do not:
 *
 *  1. **The gate list cannot silently shrink.** Every gate it names must exist as a file. A renamed test would
 *     otherwise turn into a gate that quietly stopped running — the exact failure the list exists to prevent.
 *  2. **Mode detection is real.** `[Unreleased]` is *supposed* to be full between releases. The first version of
 *     the gate demanded it be empty unconditionally and failed on a healthy tree, which is how a gate teaches
 *     people to ignore it. So the release-only rules must be gated on actually releasing.
 *  3. **Every release-specific rule fires.** Version disagreement, a missing dated section, an empty one, and
 *     `[Unreleased]` left populated at release time — each asserted against a synthetic CHANGELOG rather than by
 *     trusting the prose.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/release-gate-works.test.js
