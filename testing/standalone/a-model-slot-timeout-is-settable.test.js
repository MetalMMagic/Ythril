/**
 * Every model slot's call budget is operator-settable, and the stall floor sees whatever the operator set.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The canary operator asked why they could not configure the vision deadline (2026-08-29T1445Z). It is not one
 * constant. The **document** pipeline is fully settable — `pageTimeoutMs` / `ocrTimeoutMs` /
 * `describeTimeoutMs`, each with a config field and an admin PATCH. Every other model slot is a literal:
 *
 * | slot | where | value |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `vision` | `files/media/providers.ts` `VISION_TIMEOUT_MS` | 120 s |
 * | `vision` (external leg) | `EXTERNAL_VISION_TIMEOUT_MS` | 60 s ← the one they asked about |
 * | `stt` | `STT_TIMEOUT_MS` | 300 s |
 * | `faceExternal` | `files/media/face-external.ts` `FACE_TIMEOUT_MS` | 30 s |
 * | `nli` | `brain/nli-client.ts`, inline | 20 s |
 * | `rerank` | `brain/rerank-client.ts`, inline | 20 s |
 * | `embedding` | `brain/embedding.ts`, inline | 30 s |
 * | `docVlm` / `docRepair` / `docVerify` / `assist` | `converters/vlm-client.ts`, `?? 60_000` **five times** | 60 s |
 *
 * No env var, no config field, no admin control for any of them.
 *
 * ## Why the stall floor is half of this test and not a separate concern
 *
 * `hopBudgets()` feeds the stall detector the longest thing one job step may take, and `stall-floor.ts` raises
 * the stall timeout above it — which is what stops a long call being re-queued mid-flight, abandoning its work
 * and reaching the same step again for ever. Today it is fed the CONSTANTS. The moment a slot becomes settable
 * and the floor still reads the constant, an operator raising their vision timeout to 10 minutes gets exactly
 * that loop back, and gets it silently.
 *
 * So "settable" and "the floor sees it" are one property, asserted together. A slot that is settable and
 * invisible to the floor is worse than one that is not settable at all.
 *
 * ## What this file does NOT check, and the gate that does
 *
 * It checks that no call site holds a LITERAL and that the resolver is reached. Both stayed true while four
 * slots were inert: the document pipeline passed `timeoutMs: cfg.pageTimeoutMs` and the clients resolved
 * `opts.timeoutMs ?? slotTimeoutMs(…)`, so the caller's number won every time. The title of this file claims
 * the property; the body checks a proxy for it, and the proxy held.
 *
 * `a-slot-budget-is-not-shadowed.test.js` asserts the property itself — that what the operator set is what
 * bounds the call — and that every slot has a control to set it with.
 *
 * ## Why one resolver rather than a field on each provider block
 *
 * `MediaProviderConfig` covers vision, stt, nli and rerank — four of the ten. `embedding` has its own shape,
 * face uses an inline literal, and the four document slots are flat keys inside `DocumentProcessingConfig`. A
 * `timeoutMs` on the provider interface would need five more homes, which is the two-implementations defect by
 * construction. `EGRESS_SLOTS` already names all ten and is reused rather than duplicated — a third slot
 * vocabulary is the same defect one level up.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/a-model-slot-timeout-is-settable.test.js
 * (requires a prior `npm run build` in server/)
