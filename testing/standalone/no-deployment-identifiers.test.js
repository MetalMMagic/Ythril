/**
 * No real deployment identifier may be committed to this PUBLIC repository.
 *
 * ## Why this gate exists
 *
 * The most useful bug reports arrive with real output pasted in — a failing URL, a resolved address, a
 * warning line naming an internal service. That text then flows straight into the fix: a test asserting
 * the reported shape, a CHANGELOG entry quoting the symptom, a doc example. Each step is individually
 * reasonable and the aggregate is a public repository advertising a private cluster's topology.
 *
 * It had already happened here. A reporter's own vision endpoint, their identity provider's in-cluster
 * name, and two service ClusterIPs were committed across tests, docs and the CHANGELOG, and had been
 * public since the PR that introduced the feature. Nothing was a credential, and none of it was
 * reachable from outside their cluster — but it is free reconnaissance for anyone who ever gets a
 * foothold, and it is not ours to publish.
 *
 * ## What is checked, and why it is an allowlist
 *
 * Two shapes carry deployment topology: Kubernetes cluster-DNS names, and RFC1918 addresses. Both are
 * matched generically and compared against a list of values this repository is allowed to use.
 *
 * An allowlist, not a denylist, for a reason that matters: a denylist would have to *name the secrets*
 * to catch them, so the guard would leak exactly what it protects. Nothing in the list below is real.
 * Adding a value is a deliberate act, which is the whole point — the failure mode is paste-and-forget.
 *
 * ## When this fails
 *
 * Replace the value with a synthetic one **of the same shape**. Shape matters: the tests using these
 * assert how a hostname or a private address gets CLASSIFIED, so substituting a public address or a
 * bare word stops the test exercising what it was written for.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/no-deployment-identifiers.test.js
