/**
 * A record's own timestamp, checked against the server's — including the compact form the board actually writes.
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * breituai-platform corrected three board posts whose `postedAt` was **eight hours** early. Not clock drift: they
 * measured the clock once and extrapolated the next three stamps from how long they thought their work had taken. Their
 * sentence for why nothing caught it is the requirement — *"an estimated timestamp looks exactly like a measured one
 * once it is written down"* — and their suggestion is why it is ours: the comparison is available to the store and not
 * to the author.
 *
 * ## The parse is the substance, so it is tested against THEIR strings
 *
 * Their stamps are written `2026-08-11T1200Z`. `new Date('2026-08-11T1200Z')` is **Invalid Date**. A check built on
 * `Date.parse` alone therefore finds nothing to compare on precisely the records that motivated the ask — and reports no
 * skew for a stamp eight hours wrong. That is not a weak feature, it is one that confidently says the opposite of the
 * truth on its own motivating example.
 *
 * So the strings below are copied from the board, not invented here: `2026-08-11T1200Z`, `2026-08-12T1129Z`,
 * `2026-08-09T0942Z`. If the compact branch is ever dropped, these fail rather than quietly passing on `null`.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/stamp-skew.test.js
 * (requires a prior `npm run build` in server/)
