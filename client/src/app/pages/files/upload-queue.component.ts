/**
 * The upload panel: one row per file, with its progress and the actions its state allows.
 *
 * ## What stays behind, and why
 *
 * **The queue itself.** Ordering, the one-at-a-time rule, the HTTP subscriptions, retry and cancel semantics
 * — all of that is the page's, and it is what `file-manager.component.spec.ts`'s upload cases exercise. This
 * component reports which button was pressed and renders what it is given; it holds no state at all.
 *
 * That division is deliberate rather than minimal. An upload in flight owns a subscription, and a component
 * that owned it would abort on destroy — so navigating away from the tab, or any structural change that
 * remounted this panel, would silently cancel a running upload. The page outlives both.
 *
 * ## The actions are per-state, and that is the behaviour worth keeping in one place
 *
 * Retry belongs to a failed row, cancel to one that is queued or uploading, dismiss to one that is finished
 * either way. Written out three times in the old markup, and each `@if` was the only thing standing between a
 * user and a cancel button on a completed upload.
