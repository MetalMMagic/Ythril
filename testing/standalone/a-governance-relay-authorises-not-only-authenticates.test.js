/**
 * The governance relays authorise the caller, not merely authenticate them.
 *
 * ## What was reachable, and why it read as safe
 *
 * `POST /api/sync/networks/:id/members` and `POST /api/sync/networks/:id/votes/:roundId` carried
 * `requireAuth` and `denyReadOnly` and nothing else — no space check, no peer-membership check. Both are
 * relays: a peer calls them to report its own member record, or to pass along a vote cast.
 *
 * **The code stated the rule it did not enforce, which is the whole reason this survived reading.** The
 * members route said, in as many words: *"tokens without peerInstanceId (admin/local) may update any
 * record."* The guard in front of it tests AUTHENTICATED, and "admin/local" was a description of who was
 * expected to hold such a token rather than a check that they did. So any write-capable token could rewrite
 * any member's `url`, `label` or `children`.
 *
 * The votes route was worse, because its identity defaulted. `acceptVoteCast(net, round, cast, callerPeerId
 * ?? body.instanceId)` — with no peer id the reporter becomes the cast's OWN `instanceId`, so the two always
 * match, the own-cast path is taken, and the signature requirement is satisfied by construction. A network
 * configured with `requireSignedVotes` accepted an unsigned cast from anyone with a write token, attributed
 * to any instance, on any round — and the rounds include `remove`, `space_deletion` and `space_wipe`, which
 * pass on a single yes with no veto for `club` and `pubsub`.
 *
 * ## Why the fix is a predicate and not two guards
 *
 * This is the defect `CLAUDE.md` names as the repo's commonest, with a security blast radius: one rule —
 * *only the peer itself, or an instance administrator* — expressed twice, and the weaker copy is the one in
 * front of the route. Two inline checks would be the same bug waiting to drift, so the question is answered
 * once, by `peerRelayCaller`, and both routes take its verdict.
 *
 * The verdict is three-valued rather than a boolean because the routes need to know WHICH, not just whether:
 * a peer may speak only for itself, an admin may relay for anyone, and those are different permissions.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/a-governance-relay-authorises-not-only-authenticates.test.js
