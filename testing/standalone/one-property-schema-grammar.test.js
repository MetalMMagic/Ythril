/**
 * A property schema's grammar is written ONCE, and both doors agree on every value.
 *
 * ## The finding
 *
 * `api/schema-library.ts` declared its own `PropertySchemaZ` under the comment *"matches spaces.ts
 * PropertySchemaZ"* — a validation grammar duplicated, and acknowledged in a comment rather than shared. The
 * two objects were character-identical when this was found, which is exactly why it was worth a row: nothing
 * was broken yet, and nothing would have told anybody when it broke.
 *
 * A property schema decides what values a caller may STORE. Two copies means a value the inline door accepts
 * and the library door refuses, or the reverse, and the difference is invisible from either side. It is the
 * defect class this repo names as its most expensive, sitting behind a comment that admits it.
 *
 * ## Why the library's object is not simply the same object
 *
 * It differs in one place ON PURPOSE: `retention` is refused there. Nothing resolves a `$ref` when a retention
 * window is read — `chrono-retention.ts` and `ttl.ts` use the RAW space meta — so a window on a library entry
 * would never fire, and the field is refused with a reason rather than accepted and ignored. That difference is
 * real and is asserted elsewhere.
 *
 * So the fix is not "delete one". It is: share the grammar, keep the difference explicit. The deliberate
 * difference survives; an accidental one becomes impossible.
 *
 * ## Two directions, because both objects existing looked fine
 *
 * From the SOURCE, that there is one grammar and the library imports it. From BEHAVIOUR, that both doors return
 * the same verdict for every value in a table — including the ones the grammar is supposed to refuse, since a
 * gate that only feeds valid values cannot tell a strict schema from a permissive one.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/one-property-schema-grammar.test.js
 * (requires a prior `npm run build` in server/)
