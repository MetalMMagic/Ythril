/**
 * Every `ssrfSafeFetch` call decides `allowPrivate` on purpose — passing it, or writing down why not.
 *
 * `ssrfSafeFetch(url, init)` is a perfectly well-typed call that silently means "refuse private
 * addresses". That default is the right one, but it makes an *omission* indistinguishable from a
 * *decision*, and the omission is invisible at the call site: nothing is missing, nothing is red, the
 * code reads as complete.
 *
 * That is exactly how the model-endpoint probe shipped broken. `probeModelStages` gate-checked the URL
 * with `allowPrivateModelEndpoints()` and then called a probe that dropped the flag one line later, so
 * an operator who had correctly enabled the opt-in was told every self-hosted endpoint was SSRF-blocked
 * — while inference on those same endpoints would have worked, because every real provider client did
 * pass it. The bug lived entirely in the surface built to tell them whether it worked.
 *
 * A type cannot catch this (the parameter is optional by design, and must stay optional). A reviewer
 * catches it only by knowing which of two near-identical URL classes a given call belongs to. So the
 * rule is written down instead: pass the flag, or say `allowPrivate stays false` and give the reason.
 *
 * The distinction the reason has to make:
 *   - MODEL egress — an endpoint the operator chose to send work to. The opt-in governs it.
 *   - NOTIFICATION / CATALOG egress — a URL this server POSTs to or pulls from on an event. Pointing it
 *     inward IS the SSRF primitive, and no model-endpoint setting may relax it.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/ssrf-allow-private-coverage.test.js
