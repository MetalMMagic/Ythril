/**
 * No UI field may silently truncate below what the API accepts.
 *
 * ## What happened
 *
 * An operator authored **2,377 characters** of `usageNotes` for a new space, imported it, and read it back:
 * the text ended mid-word at `...Both were unbound`. Two rules after that sentence were gone. No error, no
 * warning, nothing on either side saying anything had been dropped.
 *
 * The cause is one attribute: the textarea carried `maxlength="2000"` while the API accepts **50,000** and
 * the docs say 50,000. A browser does not warn at `maxlength` — it silently refuses the rest of a paste.
 *
 * **Why this field in particular stings.** `usageNotes` is the instruction sheet an MCP client receives at
 * handshake. A truncated instruction sheet does not fail; it stops instructing — and what gets cut is the
 * END, which is where the specific rules live. The reporter lost their write-order and repair-on-defect
 * rules and only noticed because they happened to read the field back in the same session.
 *
 * ## What this gate checks
 *
 * Every `maxlength` in the client, against the server's `z.string().max()` for the same field name. A UI cap
 * **stricter** than the API is the defect: it discards input the API would have stored, with no error path.
 * A UI cap equal to the API is right, and one looser is harmless (the server rejects it loudly).
 *
 * It is written as a comparison, not a list of known-good numbers — a list would have been written to match
 * the values on the day and agreed with itself forever, which is how the 2,000 survived.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/ui-maxlength-matches-api.test.js
