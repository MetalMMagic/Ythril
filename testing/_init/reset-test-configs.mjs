/**
 * Wipe the bind-mounted per-instance config so the test stack boots a genuine
 * FIRST-RUN instance — exactly like CI, which starts from a fresh checkout with
 * empty config dirs (see .github/workflows/ci.yml).
 *
 * Why this matters: the instance's config.json is gitignored and lives on the host
 * via a bind mount (testing/sync/configs/<x> -> /config). `docker compose down -v`
 * removes Docker volumes but NOT this host bind mount, so a persisted config.json
 * makes the instance boot NON-first-run. That masks first-run-only bugs (e.g.
 * background workers that were gated on `!isFirstRun`) locally while CI — always
 * first-run — fails. Running this before `up` keeps local and CI in lockstep.
