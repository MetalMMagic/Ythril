/**
 * The live processing stage attached to a Files listing.
 *
 * The Files list used to say "embedding" with a spinner for the whole of a job, which looks identical
 * whether the job is working or wedged and says nothing about which of a document's stages is running.
 * The stage data and the bar that draws it both already existed — on a different endpoint and in an
 * unused component respectively — so what is new here is the join, and the join has two ways to be wrong
 * that a rendered row cannot distinguish:
 *
 *  1. **Querying for files that are finished.** Most listings are entirely finished files. Asserting on
 *     the returned rows cannot tell "did not query" from "queried and got nothing", so the lookup is
 *     injected and the calls themselves are asserted.
 *  2. **Asking the wrong space.** A media job lives in its OWN space's collection and its `_id` is the
 *     file record's `_id`. A proxy space's listing merges several members, so a lookup that ignored which
 *     member a file came from would silently find nothing for every file but the first member's.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/file-live-stage.test.js
 * (requires a prior `npm run build` in server/ so server/dist exists)

/**
 * The prefix bug this feature tripped over.

 * The client asks for the root as `path=/`, but the prefix was derived by comparing the RAW path against
 * `'.'` — so only the literal `.` was treated as the root, and `/` produced the prefix `'/'`. File records
 * store paths with NO leading slash, so the indexed range `['/', '/￿')` matched nothing: every root listing
 * came back with no status, no tags and no folder sizes. Nothing errored, the files were all still listed,
 * and an empty Status column just reads as "nothing has been processed yet". It had been that way the whole
 * time, which is exactly why a live-stage bar could not appear either.
