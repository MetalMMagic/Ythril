/**
 * The graph page's toolbar: pick a root, choose the depth and direction, toggle labels, fit and reset.
 *
 * ## Why it is a component
 *
 * G-7: the page was 690 code lines against a 650 ceiling, and the ratchet's rule is that a raise is paid with
 * an extraction rather than argued down. This is the largest self-contained block left — every control in it
 * reads page state and reports a choice back, with no knowledge of cytoscape, the traversal cache, or the
 * side panels.
 *
 * ## Every control REPORTS; none of them sets
 *
 * The obvious shape is `model()` for depth, direction and labels, and it would have been wrong: each of those
 * choices does more than change a value. A new depth or direction re-runs the traversal from the current root,
 * and toggling labels adds a class to the cytoscape edges — work this component cannot see and must not own. A
 * two-way binding moves the value and drops the rest, which leaves a toolbar whose controls look like they
 * work and change nothing. So the page keeps its three handlers and this emits into them.
 *
 * Same reasoning for `fit` and `reset`, which are commands on a canvas this component has no handle to, and
 * for `rootSelected`: choosing a root starts a traversal, which is the page's job.
 *
 * `stats` is a plain input rather than two counts, so the page decides whether there is anything to show. The
 * old markup wrapped the counts in `@if (rootEntity())`, and moving that condition here would have required
 * this component to know what a root entity is.
