/**
 * Markdown normaliser.
 *
 * Rules applied in order:
 *  0. **Normalise line endings to `\n`** (CRLF / lone CR → LF)
 *  1. Strip lines matching /^-{0,3}Page \d+.*$/i  (page-number noise)
 *  2. Collapse 3+ consecutive blank lines to exactly 1
 *  3. Shift all headings so the highest level present becomes H2
 *     (H1 is reserved for the document title; embedding model benefits from
 *      consistent heading depth).
 *
 * ## Rule 0 is not cosmetic — it decided whether a document was retrievable at all
 *
 * Everything downstream splits on `\n` and then anchors line-based patterns with `$`. In JavaScript, `$`
 * (without `m`) matches at the end of the string or before a *final* `\n` — never before a `\r` — and `.` does
 * not match `\r` either, because `\r` is a line terminator. So on a CRLF document every line arrived as
 * `"## Heading\r"` and **`/^#{2,3}\s+(.+)$/` did not match**.
 *
 * Consequence, measured on this repo's own docs: `sectionChunk` found zero headings and returned the **entire
 * document as one chunk**. A 58,737-byte API guide became a single ~14,700-token embed — which is
 * `14,700² × 4 bytes × 12 heads ≈ 9.6 GiB` of fp32 attention scores for one layer. A customer's pod went
 * 3.98 → 9.996 GiB inside one 15-second scrape window, was OOMKilled at a 16 GiB limit, and then sat at
 * 15.40 GiB at idle because the ONNX arena keeps its high-water mark. The same file was also unretrievable on
 * any specific term, because one averaged vector is not about anything.
 *
 * A Windows checkout, a Windows-authored file, or any tool that writes CRLF was enough to trigger it. Rule 0
 * is the one-line half of that fix; the other halves are `maxBodyLength` in `section-chunker.ts` and
 * `truncation` in `brain/embedding.ts`.
