/**
 * The embed-origin allowlist is reachable from the admin UI, and the UI cannot be looser than the file.
 *
 * ## What was asked for, and what the risk in answering it is
 *
 * `embed.allowedOrigins` worked and lived only in `config.json`, so granting a portal permission to frame a brain
 * meant shell access. breituai-platform asked for it in the admin UI on 2026-08-19T1046Z; the reason it is worth
 * doing is theirs: *someone runs a brain, someone else wants to use it inside a portal, and the person who must act
 * has to be talked through editing a JSON file on a server.*
 *
 * The risk in answering it is that a NEW write path to a security-relevant list is a second chance to get the rule
 * wrong. What this list grants is framing plus runtime restyling, together, which is a clickjacking primitive and a
 * UI-spoofing primitive — so the failure mode is not "the form is awkward", it is an origin nobody vetted being
 * allowed to impersonate the admin interface.
 *
 * So this gate holds the three properties that make the new path no weaker than the old one:
 *
 *  1. **ONE validator.** The route calls `isValidEmbedOrigin`, the same function the config-file path uses. A
 *     second copy — in the route or in the client — is the defect `CLAUDE.md` names as this repo's most frequent,
 *     and here the weaker copy would be deciding who may frame the admin UI.
 *  2. **A bad entry is REFUSED, not dropped.** The file path drops with a warning because nobody is waiting; a form
 *     must answer. Accepting-and-silently-dropping is the exact shape of the unscoped-token defect, where a caller
 *     was told 201 while the field they sent went nowhere.
 *  3. **The write is admin-and-MFA gated.** Their own line: *an origin allowlist that any authenticated caller
 *     could extend is not an allowlist.*
 *
 * ## Why source-level
 *
 * Driving the route needs a server, a config file and a TOTP secret, which the Docker suites have and this does
 * not. What is cheap and precise here is that the wiring cannot rot: the validator is shared, the refusal exists,
 * the middleware is the MFA one, the change is audited, and the client does not re-implement the rule.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/embed-origins-are-editable.test.js
