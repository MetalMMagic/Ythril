/**
 * `0600` on a directory is not a tightening, it is a brick — and it killed the server.
 *
 * ## What happened
 *
 * Hardening the files tree added a `chmod` after every write, so that files predating the change heal on their next
 * write instead of needing a boot-time walk. `moveFile` got the same treatment — and `moveFile` moves **directories**
 * as well as files, so a moved directory was chmodded to `FILE_MODE`. A directory without its execute bit cannot be
 * opened at all.
 *
 * Nothing failed at the move. It failed later, in the next offsite backup, as:
 *
 *     terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::filesystem::__cxx11::filesystem_error'
 *       what():  filesystem error: directory iterator cannot open directory: Permission denied
 *                [/data/files/general/meta-dir-mv-dst-.../nested]
 *
 * `fs.cpSync` walks the tree in C++. That error comes out of `std::filesystem`, not JavaScript, so it reached
 * `terminate()` and took the **whole process** down — container exit 139, 94 tests failed and 169 were cancelled
 * because every later request got `fetch failed`. One unreadable directory under the files root was enough.
 *
 * ## Why this test asserts the CHOICE and not the effect
 *
 * `chmod` is a no-op on Windows, which is where this is developed. A test that chmodded a directory and then tried
 * to read it would pass locally no matter what the code did — so `hardenPath` returns the mode it applied, and this
 * pins that. The observable effect is checked where it exists: `files.test.js` moves a real directory inside the
 * Linux container and lists it afterwards.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/harden-path-picks-the-right-mode.test.js
