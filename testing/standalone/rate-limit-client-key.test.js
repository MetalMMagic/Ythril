/**
 * Standalone tests: rate-limit buckets are keyed per CLIENT, not per source IP.
 *
 * Why this is a real bug and not a tuning preference: with no reverse proxy in front
 * (`trustProxy=false`, the default Docker deployment) every request arrives from the Docker gateway
 * address, so an IP-keyed limiter puts EVERY client of the instance into one 300/min bucket. One busy
 * client — or one buggy one, which is exactly what the brain request storm was — then 429s everybody,
 * including the app's own UI.
 *
 * `clientRateLimitKey` derives the bucket from the presented credential instead. It runs BEFORE the auth
 * middleware (that is where the limiters sit in the chain), so it works off the raw bearer rather than
 * `req.authToken`, and it must never leak that credential into a store key or a log line.
 *
 * **Header only, since 4.0.** It also read `?token=` while the MCP SSE transport authenticated that way. With
 * the transport gone, a query-string token is not a credential at all — and a bucket selected by an
 * unauthenticated string is a bucket an anonymous caller can change at will.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/rate-limit-client-key.test.js
