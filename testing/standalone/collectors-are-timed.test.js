/**
 * Every async metric collector must be timed AND bounded — because an untimed one is the one that will own the
 * ten seconds, and an unbounded one will blind the whole target while doing it.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists for
 *
 * A canary operator measured `/metrics` hitting its 10-second Prometheus timeout during an embedding run, with
 * `up=0` for two windows. They also took the measurement that **eliminates** the obvious explanation, from the
 * same scrape: event-loop lag mean 0.01006 s, p99 0.01025 s, stddev 0.00012 s. Flat 10 ms. So the handler was
 * awaiting, not hogging — and the candidates are the gauges that gather at scrape time, each walking every
 * space, several of them querying the collection the embedding worker writes to continuously.
 *
 * We cannot reproduce their load, so the instance has to report it.
 *
 * ## Why this file changed shape
 *
 * It used to assert the **mechanism**: `collectTimer(` on the first line of each collector, and a `done()` count
 * that matched. Both were hand-rolled per collector, and the timer stop sat *after* the try/catch rather than in
 * a `finally` — so an early `return` would have silently skipped it.
 *
 * `withCollectBudget()` now owns both, plus the scrape budget. That makes the guarantee structural instead of
 * remembered, so this gate asserts the guarantee:
 *
 *   1. every async collector routes through the wrapper;
 *   2. the wrapper starts its timer before anything can await;
 *   3. the wrapper stops it in a `finally`, so no path escapes measurement.
 *
 * The old assertions would now FAIL against strictly better code, which is the signature of a gate pinned to an
 * implementation. Re-pointed rather than appeased.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/collectors-are-timed.test.js
