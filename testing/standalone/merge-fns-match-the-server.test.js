/**
 * The merge functions the editor OFFERS are the ones the API ACCEPTS.
 *
 * ## The report
 *
 * Owner, 2026-08-15, editing a type's properties: *"i dont understand what i did wrong..."* — with a
 * screenshot of the schema dialog showing a wall of zod JSON,
 *
 *     mergeFn is incompatible with the declared type
 *     (numeric fns require type "number", boolean fns require type "boolean")
 *     path: [ meta, typeSchemas, entity, Task, propertySchemas, deadline ]
 *
 * They had done nothing wrong. `deadline` was type `date`, and the merge-function dropdown offered `min` —
 * all seven functions, for every type, because the control listed them as static `<option>` elements. The
 * server's `PropertySchemaZ.refine` accepts none at all on `string` or `date`.
 *
 * A control that offers a value its own API refuses has moved a validation rule into the user's head, and the
 * only way to learn it is to be refused. That is the defect; the validator is right.
 *
 * ## Why a gate rather than "we fixed the dropdown"
 *
 * The fix puts the rule in `client/src/app/shared/merge-fns.ts`, which is a SECOND COPY of a server rule.
 * This repo's most expensive recurring defect is one rule with two implementations where the weaker one wins
 * silently — so the copy is only acceptable while something compares it. This reads the server's `.refine`
 * source and the client's arrays and fails when they disagree, which turns a copy into a cache.
 *
 * If a rule is ever added that this cannot parse, it fails LOUDLY rather than passing vacuously: the counts
 * are asserted before the contents.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/merge-fns-match-the-server.test.js
