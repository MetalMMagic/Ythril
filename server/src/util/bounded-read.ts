/**
 * Bounded readers for HTTP responses from operator-configured upstreams.
 *
 * ## Why this is a shared module and not a private helper
 *
 * `boundedJson` was written in `files/media/providers.ts`, with the risk stated correctly in a comment:
 *
 * > `fetch().json()` reads the entire body without limit → a hostile or runaway upstream could exhaust heap.
 * > We cap by streaming the body and aborting once `maxBytes` is exceeded.
 *
 * It was then used at three call sites, **all inside that same file**, while twelve other `Response.json()` reads
 * across eight files went unbounded — including `files/converters/renderer.ts`, which reads rendered page images
 * as base64 strings and is the largest JSON body the server ever handles. Nothing about the reader is
 * media-specific; it was private by accident.
 *
 * ## Why nobody noticed, which is the part worth remembering
 *
 * **Every one of those call sites already had a timeout.** An audit sweep asked "is there a provider call with no
 * timeout?", found none, and moved on. A timeout bounds **duration**; it says nothing about **size**. A fast
 * upstream streaming gigabytes finishes well inside a 120-second budget. A guard on the wrong axis is more
 * dangerous than no guard, because a satisfied check is the strongest possible reason to stop looking.
 *
 * ## The realistic failure is runaway, not hostile
 *
 * Every upstream here is operator-configured — a sidecar, a local model server, an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
 * None is attacker-supplied, so this is not remotely exploitable. What it is: a sidecar bug, or an operator
 * turning render quality up. `renderDpi` accepts up to **600** and `maxPages` up to **2000** through the UI, and
 * `renderer.ts` decodes every returned page with `Buffer.from(b64, 'base64')` — so the JSON string, the parsed
 * strings and the decoded buffers are all live at once. That path needs no bug and no attacker to hurt.
 */

/**
 * Default ceiling for one upstream response body.
 *
 * 256 MiB: comfortably above a legitimate 50-page render at 600 DPI (the shipped `maxPages` default at the
 * schema's maximum quality), and far below anything that threatens the heap. Deliberately one generous number
 * rather than a per-caller guess — a cap tuned so tightly that it rejects real work would be reverted, and a
 * reverted cap protects nothing.
 *
 * `YTHRIL_MAX_UPSTREAM_RESPONSE_BYTES` raises or lowers it. An operator who has set `maxPages: 2000` at 600 DPI
 * genuinely needs more than this, and the error message says so rather than leaving them to guess.
