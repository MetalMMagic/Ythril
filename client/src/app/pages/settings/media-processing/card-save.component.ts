/**
 * One model card's Save button — shown only while that card has an unsaved change.
 *
 * ## Why this is a component and not five lines in the tab
 *
 * It was five lines in the tab, ten times over, differing only in the card id. Adding the three document
 * cards took the file 27 lines past the freeze in `no-new-god-files.test.js`, which is that gate working:
 * the answer to a file that keeps growing is to stop putting things in it. Ten copies of one rule is also
 * the defect `CLAUDE.md` names as the one this repository produces most, arriving as markup.
 *
 * ## `display: contents`, deliberately
 *
 * The button lives inside the card's footer row, which is a flex container that orders Test, Verify and Save
 * by CSS — `.testrow .card-save { order: 2; margin-left: auto }` is what pins Save to the far end. A custom
 * element is `display: inline` by default, so wrapping the button in one would have made it a single inline
 * flex item and the ordering would have silently stopped applying. `display: contents` removes this element's
 * own box, so the button is the flex item it always was and every existing rule keeps matching.
 *
 * ## The state service is required here, unlike on the card
 *
 * `app-model-provider-card` injects it optionally because it is rendered in specs that provide no page. This
 * is only ever rendered inside the page, and a Save with nowhere to save to is not a thing worth rendering.

       stopped matching it and Save rendered between Verify and the hint instead of at the far end of the
