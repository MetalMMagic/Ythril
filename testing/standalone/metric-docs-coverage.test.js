/**
 * Every metric the instance exposes is in the docs, and every metric the docs name exists.
 *
 * ## The finding
 *
 * The whole media-pipeline family — `ythril_media_jobs_pending`, `_processing`, `_completed_total`,
 * `_failed_total`, `_retried_total`, `_failed` and `ythril_media_job_duration_seconds` — was exposed on
 * `/metrics` and absent from the documentation, while every other family (http, brain, sync, mcp, auth,
 * storage, degradation, posture) was listed. Seven metrics, none of them findable.
 *
 * That is not a documentation nicety. A fleet debugging a document that would not finish asked for a gauge
 * to show one long job — and `ythril_media_jobs_processing` had been shipping the whole time. The docs are
 * how an operator learns a metric exists, so an undocumented metric is, in practice, a metric that does not
 * exist; and being told to add one that is already there is the shape of the cost.
 *
 * ## Why enumerate the registry
 *
 * A hand-written list is how this happened: someone added the media family and did not add nine rows to a
 * table in another directory. This reads `metrics/registry.ts` and compares both directions, so the next
 * metric added without a row fails here instead of being discovered by a customer.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/metric-docs-coverage.test.js
