/**
 * "These pinned field names matched nothing, so they are not locked."
 *
 * ## Why this is worth a component
 *
 * `YTHRIL_PINNED_FIELDS` lets an operator fix a field at whatever it resolves to, including nothing. Its one
 * dangerous failure is a typo: the operator believes a control is locked and it is not. The server reports those
 * entries as `pinnedUnknown` rather than only logging them, and **this screen is where somebody checking their pin
 * actually looks** — a warning in the server log is the one place they are not reading.
 *
 * ## Why it is a separate file rather than eleven lines in the Models tab
 *
 * `no-new-god-files.test.js` refused it inside `models-tab.component.ts`, which is frozen at its current size, and
 * its reason is the right one: *"the failure mode of a god-file is not its size on any given day — it is that every
 * change lands in the same place because that is where the code already is."* That tab is already 678 lines of
 * provider cards; a notice about environment pins has no reason to live inside it.
 *
 * It also earns the separation on its own terms — it has one input, no state, and nothing to do with any provider
 * card, so a reader looking for why an unrecognised pin is surfaced finds one file that says so.
 *
 * Rendered ABOVE the cards by its host. Below them it would be found only by somebody who had already scrolled
 * past the control they thought was locked, which is the wrong conclusion this exists to prevent.
