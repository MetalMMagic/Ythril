/**
 * Nothing in a client template is drawn behind a condition that can only ever be one value.
 *
 * ## What this is for (`Q-13`)
 *
 * The Media Processing page rendered the outcome of every save — the server's refusal and its reason, and
 * the confirmation that a save was stored — inside one block, and that block was guarded by a computed
 * whose whole body was the literal `false`. So it never appeared, on any tab, for any card. A refused save
 * looked exactly like a button that did nothing, and a successful one looked the same.
 *
 * An operator hit it against 4.0.0 and spent an hour not knowing which field the API was objecting to. The
 * reason had been sent, received and stored in a signal the entire time.
 *
 * ## Why the gate is on the CONSTANT and not on the message
 *
 * The obvious gate — "the refusal signal is referenced by a template" — would have been green throughout.
 * The reference existed. What made it dead was the guard around it, and that is the part a reader skims:
 * `@if (showsSave() && ...)` reads as a real condition, and the name is a promise the body does not keep.
 *
 * A condition that cannot vary is either scaffolding somebody forgot to remove or a feature that was
 * switched off in a place nobody looks. Both are the same defect from the operator's side: a control that
 * is documented, wired, and invisible. Delete the branch, or give the flag a real source.
 *
 * The `true` half is included deliberately. It is the cheaper mistake — the block renders — but it is the
 * same lie about the code, and it is what a `false` becomes when somebody "fixes" it in a hurry.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/no-control-is-rendered-behind-a-constant.test.js

/**
 * The spellings of "this value is decided here and never changes again".
 *
 * A `computed` is the one that hid, because it is the shape that looks most like real logic — it is a
 * function, so nothing about the call site suggests the answer is fixed. A `signal(false)` that is never
 * `set` is the same thing arrived at differently, and is left to a future pass: proving a signal is never
 * written needs the whole component, and a rule that is only half-checkable is worse than a narrow one
 * that is exact. See *A gate concludes about MORE than it checks* in CLAUDE.md.
