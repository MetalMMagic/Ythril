/**
 * One cell of the rights matrix: an escalation, not four checkboxes.
 *
 * ## Why an escalation
 *
 * Each rung CONTAINS the one below it, so "write but not read" is not a thing that can be expressed. Four
 * checkboxes would let somebody save it, and the server would then have to decide what it meant — which is
 * a decision nobody should be making at read time.
 *
 * ## Two behaviours that are easy to get wrong
 *
 *  - **Clicking the current rung steps DOWN one.** Without it, a cell can only ever go up by clicking and
 *    down by clicking a specific lower segment, which reads as "the control resists being narrowed".
 *  - **Rungs below the floor are clamped, not hidden.** The floor is set on another row entirely, so a cell
 *    that silently refuses to go lower with no visible reason looks broken. Dimmed-and-titled says why.
 *
 * ## Two sources of a minimum, one clamp
 *
 * A cell also cannot go below what another AREA entails: `knowledge: write` needs `schema: read` to be
 * exercisable at all, so the server grants it (`RUNG_IMPLICATIONS`, resolved in `effectiveRung`). Both the
 * floor and an implication are the same thing to this control — a minimum with a reason — so they share one
 * clamp rather than getting one mechanism each. The title names whichever is BINDING, because a reader who
 * cannot lower a cell wants the one fact that would let them.
 *
 * The implication is not hard-coded here. It arrives from `GET /api/tokens/rights-catalog`, which publishes
 * what the server enforces; a copy typed into the client would be a second description of a security rule.
 *
 * ## The tooltip says what the rung GRANTS, then what the click does
 *
 * Owner, 2026-08-15: *"the tooltip on hovering a rung is still missing."* It was not absent — it was
 * answering the wrong question. It read `Set write` and `Set write — click again to step down`, which
 * describes the CLICK. Somebody hovering a cell in a permissions grid is asking what the rung grants; the
 * click is confirmation of a choice they have already made.
 *
 * The answer was already written and already translated — sixteen `tokens.rights.plain.<area>.<rung>` strings
 * in all three locales, which the column-header glyph has been using all along. This control could not reach
 * them for one reason: it did not know its own area. Both call sites have it in scope, so it is now an input.
 *
 * Capability first, action second, and when a cell is clamped the clamp explanation is APPENDED rather than
 * substituted — "why can I not go lower" is still a live question in that state, but so is "what would it
 * give me if I could".
