/**
 * What an operator sets for a slot is what bounds that slot's call — and every slot has a door to set it.
 *
 * ## The defect, and why nothing ever contradicted it
 *
 * `a-model-slot-timeout-is-settable.test.js` is titled *"every model slot's call budget is
 * operator-settable"*. Its body checks that no call site holds a LITERAL and that `slotTimeoutMs(` appears
 * somewhere in each file. Both were true of the document pipeline and the budget was still unreachable:
 *
 * ```
 * // vlm-client.ts               opts.timeoutMs ?? slotTimeoutMs(slot, getModelSlots())
 * // vlm-extract.ts, four sites  transcribePageImage(img, { ...ep, timeoutMs: cfg.pageTimeoutMs })
 * ```
 *
 * `??` takes the left side whenever it is present, so `pageTimeoutMs` won every time and the resolver was
 * dead code on that path. Four slots — `docVlm`, `docRepair`, `docVerify` and `assist` — were documented in
 * the field table, accepted by the admin PATCH, pinnable through `YTHRIL_PINNED_FIELDS`, and had no effect
 * whatsoever.
 *
 * **The two defaults are both 60 000 ms.** So the number an operator read and the number the code used
 * agreed exactly until somebody changed one, which is why a gate, a field table and a canary report could
 * all coexist with it for a release. This is the shape `CLAUDE.md` calls a gate concluding about more than
 * it checks: the title claims the property, the body checks a proxy for it, and the proxy stayed true.
 *
 * ## So this gate asserts the RULE, at the point where the number is used
 *
 * Not "the resolver is mentioned" — that is what was already checked. The budget handed to `AbortSignal` has
 * to be one the operator's setting can win, which means the caller's own number may only be a DEFAULT.
 * `slotTimeoutMsOr` is the one place that ordering lives, and a `??` in front of a resolver call is the
 * shadowing spelled out.
 *
 * ## And the door, because a reachable setting nobody can reach is the same defect one layer up
 *
 * Reported by the canary operator 2026-09-06 §6(c): the ten per-slot budgets had seven doors. `rerank` was
 * among the seven and is the one they needed — the reranker switching itself off on large spaces was traced
 * to the 20 s default — but `docVlm`, `docRepair` and `docVerify` had none, and `05b-media-embedding.md`
 * states there is deliberately no environment variable for these, which makes that screen the only door.
 *
 * The set is derived from `MODEL_SLOTS`, never listed here: a corrected list is the same defect with a
 * later expiry date, and this repository has paid for that twice in one sweep already.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/a-slot-budget-is-not-shadowed.test.js
 * (requires a prior `npm run build` in server/)
