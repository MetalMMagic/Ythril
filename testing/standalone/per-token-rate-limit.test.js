/**
 * A rate limit an admin sets per token, under a ceiling infra sets instance-wide.
 *
 * Owner request 2026-08-20, in two parts: *"ratelimit should be settable on token by instance admin"* and *"and
 * instancewide by infra"*.
 *
 * ## What is worth testing, and what is a Docker suite's job
 *
 * Not "does a 429 arrive after N requests" — that needs a running instance and belongs in the integration
 * suite. What is cheap and exact here is the part that decides WHICH number applies, and the part that decides
 * whether a write is allowed to set it. Both are pure, and both have a wrong answer that is silent:
 *
 *  - a resolution that reads the wrong tier gives a token a quota nobody granted;
 *  - a refusal that clamps instead of refusing tells an admin their number was accepted when a smaller one was
 *    stored, which is the defect `api/tokens.ts` already carries a long comment about one field over.
 *
 * ## And the structural half, which is the part that rots
 *
 * The quota is metered in `attachToken`, the one function every auth entry point calls. That is deliberate:
 * there are nine such entry points and wiring the limiter at any subset leaves the rest uncounted. So this file
 * asserts that arrangement directly — a tenth auth path added without metering is exactly the regression that
 * would produce a quota with a hole in it and no failing test.
 *
 * Run: node --test testing/standalone/per-token-rate-limit.test.js
 * (requires a prior `npm run build:server`)
